hRMj3I4fi0nu_lG3y6M4iw,4,"CORN BREAD!!!!!!  For years now I have been complaining about how bad the cornbread in Nashville is.  Not really corn bread at all.  The corn bread at this place is bananas.  Well, not really of course, but it's really good.  How many times can I use the word ""really"" in a review?  Let's find out.

So the BBQ here is really (1) good also.  In fact, it is really (2), truly the best I have had in Nashville.  While I really (3) have been wanting to get down to Memphis and try what they are famous for, it really (4) hasn't been in the cards.

I had the pork sandwich with a side of really (5) good grits and green beans.  We also had some smoked chicken wings.  So good.  

In short you really (6) out to try this place.  It is really (7), really (8) good.  So very impressed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
FX8R25gZHQKlY7qI4MsuaQ,4,"I love St. Joseph's Brewery. I love the atmosphere. I love the beers. I love the staff. And I love the patios. Heck, I even love the DIY bloody mary bar that they offer up for Sunday brunch, even though I haven't tried it out yet.   I love bringing out of town guests here because I love showing off St. Joseph's to them. It's such a great place to order a few beers and catch up, no matter if you're sitting inside or out. 
But what's a girl got to do to get a few decent vegetarian plates on the menu? Folks rave on and on about how delicious all the food is here. I'd love to try it out for myself. The only plate that's vegetarian is the house salad. Don't get me wrong--it's delicious. But come on. It's 2020. Let's expand that menu to include some vegetarian plates!",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0

BcfRPvN5unPSMnQxlwBvng,4,"Excellent food and service.

I've been here twice, and I've been pleased thus far.  The pulled pork BBQ sandwich with mango BBQ sauce is excellent, and the grilled meatloaf is to die for.  If you like meatloaf as much as I do, then you know how hard it is to find a place that serves it up properly.  In my opinion, this might be the best meatloaf I've ever eaten.

Also, the appetizers are simply amazing.  I always thought that The Conch House over in St. Augustine has this recipe on hemlock, but they have some serious competition at Rumba.  In fact, I'd say that Rumba's are better.  But don't sleep on the jerky wings appetizer because you like conch fritters.  You absolutely have to try these wings.  

As for desserts, I like the key lime pie a lot, but last night my bro ordered a rum cake and all I can say is ""wow.""

L8j6qfS3NJ50goQCG3SAjg,2,"First off, their WEBSITE is way old and the menu is way outdated. They do not serve any of the steaks or chicken dishes as listed on their web menus anymore. No more primerib for $14.99 folks, they don't even have it. I spoke to the manager and she told me that the guy that designed their site took the password and his talents as a  webmaster with him. They've been unable to hire anyone to fix the website and menus. Travelling through Boise and eat here AND want to use the KopperRest WIFI you will see on your wifi list, OOPS, they don't know how to fix that either and blamed it being plugged in and sort of working, but non-connectable, to the same webmaster that walked away years ago.
So, the food was very average, maybe a tiny bit better than Denny's across the street. 
1- get your website back, it's not difficult. You can verify who you are and get the domain and hosting released to your care
2- fix your wifi or unplug the router.
3- Tell your waitresses to actually try the items on the menu. Our waitress was a uneducated person when it came to Kopper's own menu. I asked her how long she'd been there, she said a few years, but she couldn't recommend even a dressing for the salad.
4- It reminds me of a truck stop café, wasn't overlay impressed with the service or the food. They DO have daily specials and the all you can eat shrimp looked great, my fellow diners liked them.
5- Ask your customers if they have any coupons or local motel discounts.",0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0
0J2UZ0MA44jy4rBQLdSHlQ,5,"we had a wonderful meal here very recently with lovely friends from nyc.  They are used to the best, so we brought them to the best!

we had all the classic greek appetizers, saganaki, oktopothi (octopus) and kalamarakia (squid), which were superb, but the great thing here is the fresh fish.

Special note;  they have a terrific extensive raw bar of oysters here!  it is superb.  My wife rated them 10/10.  Philly has some fine oyster spots, but they are all in the city, eg the Palm, et al.  This is really the only suburban spot we've been to with a great raw oyster bar. 

they keep fresh fish/catch of the day on ice, which the waiter brings to your table and displays!

This is great.  my wife and i had a greek fish called fagri that was amazing--we split it and it was very filling!!! and entire fish with the head, plus greens & sides.  Beautiful and delicious.  

Our kids and friends ordered equally great entrees, fish and meats--the lamb and meat dishes are terrific.

They have a good dessert menu and greek coffee.  

One caveat;  its expensive here.  $$$$.  But this is the very high end greek dining experience (short of going to nyc or Astoria or chicago or Greece) you've been craving.",1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

The chicken sandwich -Roasted chicken , avocado, Swiss cheese, chipotle mayo. It sounds simple but it was delicious.  But, I actually liked my salad much much more.  It was crispy, savory, a bit sweet.

I ordered very simple fare -- a chicken tender plate with french fries -- but sometimes the simple dishes are the best. Everything on the plate was delicious, and even after eating my fill, I still had plenty to take home to make a second meal out of it the next day. 

The table also ordered a plate of onion rings, which were particularly excellent. As onion rings go, they were lightly breaded---I would almost describe them as delicate, which is not an adjective I typically associate with onion rings---but still crispy and crunchy and perfect. Extra perfect, perhaps. They don't let you order them as a ""free side"" with regular entrees, and I can see why. But that's probably them doing you a favor -- once you have a single ring, you're probably going to want a full order of them.

I went recently for a networking meeting with an old colleague. I was sat immediately and offered coffee, yes please. The breakfast menu is your typical diner type things - eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes, etc. I ordered an egg white omelet with a side of fruit and dry toast.

I was disappointed that the menu, which is seasonal, was not right on Google.  I almost left because of the disappointment. But I let the bartender guide me, and had a phenomenal experience for the second time.

I've been to this place multiple times and this was the worst. It started with my server name Gina, (not sure if thats her real name because she said it with an attitude when asked), she was very rude and should never work in customer service because she simply is not cut for it. Next was the food, my family member ordered a grill chicken and was not happy with it. Therefore, very politely she told the server about it and the server ""Gina"" goes ""I cannot take it back"" then walks away. Five mins later she come back and says, "" The manager/owner in the kitchen said I can remove it from the bill"". My family member then goes, ""May I order something else?"" The server then goes, ""No!"" So I ask may I order food and she goes, ""No one can order food from this table"". We then ask may we speak to a manager, she then goes, ""No, you cannot see a manager and if you do, he will kick you out."" Next I ask the hookah guy who refills hookah, ""Can I see a manager?"" He then goes, ""There's no manager here and I cannot get him, he's mean"". I am very disappointed in this establishment and they need to fire ""GINA"" and apparently needs new manager.

This might be a place to come if you are trying to impress ""foodies"" but if you really love to eat I suggest either going elsewhere (like Amis) or make sure you are not really hungry at dinnertime. For example, the scallop/pork belly dish consisted of a single scallop, a 1 by 2 inch piece of pork belly, and 2 tiny watermelon squares.  The flavor and presentation of this dish was incredible, but after tasting it I wanted more. I wish I could have ordered 3 of these.

Unfortunately they don't have halibut on the menu, so we tried the basa and the catch of the day (Snapper). You have the choice of classic (battered and deep fried) or pan-fried -- we went classic for both. The fish was nicely battered and fried well without being greasy. I particularly liked the snapper so I hope to see it as the catch of the day regularly. Tartar sauce was delicious. Fries were fresh cut and tasty. Also tried the Niçoise salad which was a delicious lighter option--the tuna was perfect with potatoes, eggs, and green beans. The banoffee pie was a small portion for $7, but very good. The only miss was the cheddar biscuit which came out a bit too dry and crumbled into small pieces when I cut it.

If you are looking for genuine Chesapeake area food - this is the place (and I may add, the only place to get your Md grub on in the Tampa Bay area).

Blake's Cakes are the real deal - I even brought a few extra home and reheated them the next day and they were still better than any I've had anywhere else in Florida.
If you're from the DC/Baltimore area (or ever been) and are searching for that unmistakeable authentic Maryland Crab Cake -- this is your place!  Try the Old Bay fries while you're there!!

Very filling and very satisfying, the vegan egg was soft and squishy  which was a nice change from the usual dry, crumbled tofu you get subbing egg at most other veg restaurants. The tofu slabs were well formed and browned perfectly on the outside. The biscuits were dense and heavy like any good tea biscuit.  I thought the sandwich might be too dry and was tempted to ask for ketchup, but the vegan egg mix proved to be ""creamy"" enough to balance out the biscuit and fried tofu.   It is not often I don't reach for ketchup and hot sauce with my savoury breakfasts so this was a plus. Though there is a server who takes your order and brings you your food and drinks, you must go up to the till to pay your bill after your meal and there is a station for you to fix up your own coffee. They offered dairy milk and coconut creamer. The coconut creamer was heavy on the coconut flavour making my java a tropical caffeine kick. It is not the coconut creamer I am familiar with, and while I wouldn't want my coffee like that every day, it was a welcome alternative to black coffee at the time. All the baking they sell is vegan (there is a sign that says so) but it was not explicitly clear how much of the menu was vegan. Given that they offer dairy creamer, I think it's best to ask, clarify, and request just to be safe. 

Clever Rabbit gets 4 stars because the coconut creamer interfered with my coffee's flavour, because my picky friend said her French Toast was soggy, and because it was such a fast meal and my first time there that I can't feel confident saying they are 5 stars for sure.

I only wish I'd had the opportunity to sample the baking as it looked inviting. If it is anything like the biscuit in my meal, than it must be yummy.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0

JdNHqWNJeTKRwhmbl8G5WQ,1,"2nd time at the k&k. Service was terrible this time! Actually ruined the whole night. Hubby and I went back for one last date night sans kiddo and pre new kiddo.  We were there last weekend for dinner as well since we were gifted it. (See other review).

 Having made reservations, I was seated right away and waited as hubby parked the car. The waitress came over almost immediately to take my drink order. Since I wasn't drinking alcohol,  it was a quick order of a sprite for me.  When hubby arrived,  waitress ran over for his drink order, which was prompt;  however, since there is quite an extensive beer list,  he wasn't able to peruse over it liked he wanted to. It was ok since we were here last week and saw what was going to be tapped this weekend. He was prepared for his first pour. We also put in an appetizer order, the hummus.

The beer and appetizer came out almost immediately.  When the waitress dropped the appetizer off she also took our dinner order.  Having drank all my soda and water, i had to ask the waitress for refill. The refill came out right away. 

Half way through eating the appetizer, our diner order came out.  I HATE it when your dinner order has come out and the dirty appetizer plates haven't been removed, let alone you are still eating and enjoying it!

However,  we finished the appetizer while eating over our dinner plates.   The waitress came back and cleared our plates after I stacked them since now the tint two person table was overly crowded.

We had cut our turkey burger and sandwich in half and then in quarters to share a bite. The waitress came over and asked if we wanted to take our food home???? We barely started to eat. Read one bite out of my sandwich. We said not yet but she took another beer order for hubby. We continued to eat. She Never came back with the beer...ever. In fact she went missing for a good 15 minutes,  which was good because we actually got to eat but bad because hubby and now I were thirsty without beer/soda/water. 

Side note: I ordered the turkey burger since I enjoyed the wings last time. However the Turkey burger was poorly seasoned,  and tasted like plain hot sauce, not the hot and honey it was stated to be. The blue cheese was also missing from the burger. Hubby got a sandwich with ham, the greasy fried chicken I had gotten as a meal last weekend and a bunch of other stuff; however it was so overpowered with chili in adoboe sauce it was nauseating.

Three quarters through our meals we were disgusted and thirsty,  server finally came back, sans beer, and asked if we were ready for the check.  Absolutely disgusted by both the service (*lack thereof) and the food, we said yes. When the check came we were curious if the second beer was one it or not since we never received it. It was! We flagged down the waitress and told her we never received it and she glanced on the table and said ""oh no you didn't"", I'll take it off. She never offered to go get it.  Hubby was thirsty and wanted a drink since his meal was spicy and salty, but at that point he was so aggravate he ignored it.  Since we placed our payment in the folder she walked off with the rwceipt and payment, when she came back she just mentioned she had removed the beer from the receipt,  no apologies. 

Our Saturday date night dinner with an appetizer, meal, drink(s), consisted of  a sum total of 45 minutes from when I walked in the front door of the restaurant till I walked out the door. I like prompt service but this wasn't it it,  it was poor and rushed, and I left feeling like I ate at McDonald's. At least there I can get up and get myself a refill!",0.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I waited until after 3 experiences before leaving a review so I know 100% that it wasn't a fluke or someone's ""bad day."" No, this is something much much more.

Pluses to help minimize risk w Covid
- outdoor seating, well-spaced apart.
- take out available of course, you order ahead of time and pick up (you can't go inside if you're picking up)
- you cannot just walk in. This is monitored based on how busy they are and on the size of your party. Use Yelp's get in line feature in advanced to see the current situation.
- servers wear masks (the Callowhill location also wears face guards!)
- limited indoor seating (no plexiglass required in this location as it is very spaced out, whereas the Callowhill location has plexiglass as people are closer)
- hand sanitizers at every table

The service here is quite nice and the people checking you in when you show up for a table are very attentive and helpful.

If you want more talkative and attentive service from your wait staff, the Callowhill location is the way to go, hence that's why that location gets one more star comparing to this one. If dining outdoors is a priority (which it is when I am with high-risk Covid people), then Wynnewood is your location.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Shrimp cocktail: 
- not adequately cleaned
- plated in water
- served with middling cocktail sauce

Oyster sampler plate (raw, BBQ & fried):
- raw ones were not adequately cleaned and induced gag reflex -- I could not get through them
- BBQ ones were served underneath a hot mess of western omelette-style odds and ends like ham chunks and peppers. Perhaps this is a local delicacy? To me it's an international gross-out
- fried ones were coated in a dull, tasteless breading you get on fried fish in summer camp in 1978 -- not a quality year for bread crumbs, I might add
- served with 2 ""vegetables."" I chose fries (not great) and macaroni salad (painfully average)

Coconut cake:
- tiniest slice you ever did see
- not terrible, not great either

Coffee:
- fine

Bloody Mary (2):
- pretty decent, actually. Spicy and strong. No celery or vegetables of any kind -- just ice, pepper and a cute pastel bendy-straw so you can get right to work

After finally making it to Indy from San Diego, I knew that I had to stop in and see what all of the fuss was about. To my surprise, everything that was said about the dough shop was spot on. It was an afternoon and this cozy eatery was steady with business. They had openings in both of their indoor and outdoor seating. The special of the day was the meatball sub. As soon as I saw it, I was in. I couldn't wait to try the meal. It came with a salad and some of their delicious homemade pasta that I had been hearing so much about. I sank my teeth into the succulent sandwich and let me tell you, it was PHENOMENAL! The pasta was much better than any pasta I had ever had. It's one of those things that I didn't think would be THAT recognizable. I was surely experiencing a case of serendipity. Next, I had to get to the main event! The reason that this place was so hyped up amongst my friend circle...the SCONES! Cip had just taken a batch of pumpkin scones out of the oven and I was happily awaiting a bite of the fresh cooked dough. Again, I sank my teeth into the delicious morsel of food and went directly into a state of pure ecstasy! It's almost as if the scone was invented by this family. I'm not kidding. These scones are so good that I will only refer to the commonly known pastry by its true name if it has been crafted by the hands of the McMannis family.

bWueKAuvyo5XW4wvXw7OTw,4,"BJ's has a fantastic happy hour. It's the number one reason I come here. Not only does it run until 7, but they give a 50% discount on all appetizers, flatbreads, and mini pizzas. There's a lot of items to choose from. They also have beer specials. Sure they're a chain brewery, but their beer is still very good. I'm a fan of the blonde. My husband likes the pale and the red. Some of the seasonals are also great. 

I've never gotten a table from the hostess and ordered a full dinner, so I can't review that part of their food and service. When I come here I always sit in the bar area and order an appetizer or two for a small dinner. The bar area (including the tables) is open seating, and it's usually easy to find somewhere to sit. Service is usually fast. My favorite app is the avocado egg rolls (which don't actually contain eggs). The sweet tamarind dipping sauce sets them off perfectly. I'm also a big fan of the potato skins. The mini Pepperoni Extreme is also great.

wwIRcNIzXXqKMMXPxWih5A,3,"Oh Pastaria. I wanted to like you more... I've been hearing this restaurant's praises for a good little minute over the last couple of years and couldn't wait to see what the fuss was about. I finally made my way there this past Friday for lunch. The place was packed but there were still some empty tables sprinkled throughout the dining room. I waited a while for the host to greet me, but he was nowhere to be found. So I just stood there waiting, and waiting. Then he finally showed up and took me to my table. The restaurant is very loud.The tables are very close together. At one point, I found myself in the splash zone as my waiter spilled some water on my foot while refilling the glasses of my neighboring table. He didn't notice, didn't apologize, and I didn't confront him about it. The people at his table did notice however and looked down at my foot and the small puddle on the floor left behind. Le sigh...

I ordered the lunch special of the Puttanesca with green salad. I failed to read on the menu what was in the salad, otherwise I would not have ordered it. It had apples and nuts, which I'm not a fan of either in my salad really. However, I'm sure for someone who likes a salad with that combo, they'd be in hog heaven at seeing it offered as an included side salad. I wish that the menu gave more descriptions of some of these ""basic"" pasta dishes. Not all of us are Italian or have eaten the ""finest"" varieties of pastas ever to know what some of the dishes were, so having descriptions in the menu would have been a great idea.Luckily between my waiter and Google, I figured out what was being served on the lunch menu. I know that the restaurant is going for more of a stream-lined, simple, and elegant menu, but please inform me what you're serving me. Thanks. 

The Puttanesca seemed to true to the recipe, and all of the necessary elements were present in the dish. Pastaria offers fresh complimentary bread, which is kept and carved at a table in the middle of the dining room. After finishing my first piece of bread, I wanted to ask for more. I took a phone call while waiting and before I could stop her, a busser came through and took my plate without a second thought. I flagged my waiter down shortly after to bring me more bread and another plate. I didn't like that. I know it might have seemed a certain way because I was on the phone, but I was by myself, she still could've asked.

The restaurant is very light and open as both the pasta kitchen and main kitchen of the restaurant are exposed. For a casual, yet higher quality Italian pasta restaurant, I'd say look no further than Pastaria, but I wasn't as blown away by my experience as most people are by their's, I guess.",0.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

Sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. The manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. This restaurant really needs to rethink their process. The stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. Not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. Or I would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing.

I can comment on the food though. Not good.
Got wonton soup. ""Traditional chicken broth filled with wontons and vegetables. One order comes with 12 wontons.""
There were lots of wontons, to be sure. And one piece of broccoli. Maybe update the description to read ""vegetable,"" singular. The wontons themselves were okay. Not the best I've had, but it's also pretty hard to mess them up. Presumably these are not hand made or anything. And it's a simple chicken broth...

Luckily I also ordered One Colour Rice Dish. It was one colour. A brown colour. It had some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots though, so I tossed those in the soup. I ate a bit of the chicken and the sauce was kinda... Well, I saved it in the fridge anyhow. I'm going to use it as a base to make an actual good sauce later. I would have been pretty disappointed if I had to eat what was given.

Had a spring roll. Was crunchy and passable. You won't weep with pleasure or anything. You'll be like, ""I suppose that's how a spring roll tastes.""
Had some green onion cake. Was doughy. Not very crisp. Lacking in green onions. Also only came with soy sauce, not any fancy stuff. Strangely overly salty, even though soy sauce is suppose to be salty. I would recommend avoiding these. Unless you're into what I just described for some reason, then go for it.

You can tell that a lot of thought is put into the bakery -- from the handwritten menu board to the perfectly matched flavors of the baked goods. I did think the bakery was a little hard to find because there isn't a large sign, I accidentally missed it when I first drove by. It's located in a small little strip with some parking spaces out front.

The inside has plenty of seating with the baked goods on display for you to grab. The woman (I think the owner?) was super nice! She told me that most of the items on the shelves can be made fresh if there aren't any more. She was all around just extremely friendly and helpful, making sure my order was correct.

I ended up getting the taro bun and the strawberry matcha latte. The strawberry puree for my drink ran out, so they had to make some fresh puree, which honestly didn't take too long at all. But again, the woman was super nice and apologetic about it. The strawberry matcha was delicious! It wasn't overly sweet and the puree was super fresh.

The atmosphere is relaxing and adorable, and the service is great. I haven't had a lot of Cuban food, so our waitress pointed out some dishes that she thought would be great to try. We also tried a Cuban drink, Iron Beer, which is sort of like a root beer, and it was delicious! If you like root beer and orange cream soda, that's kinda what it tastes like. 

For eats, we started with the guava and cheese empanadas that was so highly recommended on yelp. It did not disappoint! I honestly would prefer eating that to a Long's donut, any day (but that's just my opinion). For our entrees, my boyfriend got the vaca fritas (?), a shredded beef dish with lemon juice, onions, etc. My only beef with this dish (pun fully intended) was how chewy the beef was. However, I still rate this restaurant as a 5-star place because the flavors were so phenomenal. I got the roast pork, and it was AMAZING!!!!! The meat practically melted in my mouth, and when combined with the sauce (a mild, tamarind vinegar?), it was orgasmic. We finally finished with a small Cuban coffee with a splash of milk, which was very yummy. Overall, I will definitely be back!

Our server was lack luster, no enthusiasm and she didn't even smile. It took forever to get bread, much less our food (the restaurant appeared to only have a small handful of tables occupied). The food was barely mediocre (not good for $14-20 a plate). I ordered the churrasco steak with chimichurri sauce. It was an open faced sandwich (not detailed on the menu, but the waitress let us know before hand). It was way over cooked and lacking any real flavor. The ""sauce"" that accompanied it was minimal and had no garlic (kind of a staple for that sauce). I would have requested more if my waitress showed us a little more attention. I also ordered a side of the Parmesan chips. These were a waste of $4. The were homemade chips (bonus), but the cheese was sparsely spread on the chips. I will say that the pretzel bread with smoked butter was good, but we needed more butter. Once again, the waitress took far too long to return.

They microwaved the heck out of the marinara sauce to the point of it being sticky and dry! I've never seen that before. We muddled through the app even though it was cold, hoping for a hot meal. My wife ordered a BBQ chicken salad, and I ordered a simple fried chicken sandwich. After another 5-10 minutes they showed up. Wouldn't you know, my meal was cold and even her chicken on the salad was cold. Also she was never asked what dressing she required so it showed up dry!! Dry!! And looked like crap on a plate!!! I called the ""manager"" over znd he agreed the meals were cold, we left soon after. It seemed that the bar got the largest attention and everyone else second. Worst experience ever!!

mHRrVCmMBvGJ0nCBNzmkgw,1,"I have been eating at the dining car for 10+ years, sadly I will not be back. Over the years the food has changed, portions have gotten smaller and prices are rising. Although they say they will not accept credit cards to keep prices down. Keep prices down?  I ordered a turkey club for $9.50 and it came with no fries and literally a small souffle cup of coleslaw containing maybe a tablespoon or two. The sandwich was soggy, and literally had 1 piece of bacon on if. This is probably one of the worst turkey clubs I've ever had. For $9.50 it should come with fries and actually have some bacon. My wife ordered a chicken ceaser salad. It's was almost $13.00! For a salad! She said it was just ok and rather large. Maybe the dining car should offer a smaller option for half the price? Total check for sandwich, salad and kids meal was $37.00..ridiculous! I don't mind high prices when food is worth it. We have had the exact same meal at a diner cape may for $25.00

As for the service.. Well it was terrible. We went around 3pm, which was change of shift. Not a good idea! It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. 30 minutes for a salad and sandwich. And their glasses are getting smaller, so more refills are needed but the waitstaff if nowhere to be found.

tKuNgQhDoEj4AIp1N5rt3g,1,"I see most people have flocked to Bono's because they are personally familiar with actual Chicago food while living in the Chicagoland area.  I'm not different; I grew up in the Chicagoland area and spent a total of 18 years there.

I go out of my for authentic Chicago food; especially pizza.  I've gone as far as to mail order Giordano's stuffed pizza.  After finding out about Bono's, I was amped to no end.  Today we ordered a stuffed Canadian Bacon and Pineapple pizza.  I couldn't stop talking about how excited I was.  When I saw our pizza was up, the excited look on my face was replaced with disappointment.

This ""stuffed pizza"" was an epic fail in every sense.  It felt and tasted like the pizza was made by taking a thin crust pizza, putting toppings, sauce and cheese on it and topping it off with another layer of thin crust pizza.  The taste was decent for what it was but any true Chicagoan would be embarrassed to associate this pizza with Chicago.

As for the service, the female that took our order was also delivering food to the tables.  She seemed a bit out of it but she wasn't rude at all.

I can sum up my visit in one line:  If you are AT ALL familiar with true Chicago food, think twice and think hard about visiting Bono's.  Though the food is decent, it can't hold a candle to authentic Chicago dining.

EDIT:  I'm sitting here having a cold piece of my ""stuffed"" pizza (because I'm hungry, not because I like it) and half way through, I'm overwhelmed with disappointment yet again.  I REALLY wanted to like this place but I reckon I got what I paid for.  I'm now going to throw away the remaining 50% of my pizza :(",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

x2xReNeBaxG5xAffjZiD3w,1,"I've eaten tacos and flour tortillas all my life (over 40 yrs) - these are the worst flour tortillas I've ever had.   Oh, but they're authentic!!!! Big whoop.  Not good.  RioBravo (closed) & the place on 60 had/have a tortilla press machine that smashes fresh doughballs and then they cook them - that makes a great tortilla to eat your food with.  Just because you use some 100 yr old recipe and hand pound a tortilla doesn't mean thats what people want to eat.

And those ""homemade"" tortilla chips that you have to pay for are TERRIBLE.  My goodness.  Forget whether or nor they have enough salt or not.  They are almost inedible because they are so thick and hard. The ""free refill"" isn't worth it.  I wanted to get my money back after a few chips but we didn't want to make waves so early into our dinner.

Ordered an assortment of tortillas.  The two fish tacos I'd never order again. The fried pork was really dry.  You guys are cooking chicken right there on the grill -- so why is a chicken taco so dry?  How can you kill the chicken so bad?  Carne Asada was ""just ok"".  Best taco was the other pork which had a nice sauce - that helped moisten it. 

We enjoy fajitas but I'd hate my meal if I had to eat it with those tortillas - and I'd hope the chicken wasn't overcooked.  

This is SOOOOOO middle of the road - actually less than that.  He's really got to change his stuff if he wants to survive.  I will never go back.  My decision has nothing to do with anyone's personality or attitude or mother/grandmother or fancy story or cleanliness of the place - I mainly care about the food and this is not worth it.
BTW, one Haas avocado ($1.00) makes (3) 2oz. portions of smashed avocado.  I will not order a little 2oz portion cup side of guac for $2 - its only $.33 worth of product so a hefty markup for them.  Maybe $1, but not $2.

King Dough is my go-to pizza spot in downtown Indy. If you like classic toppings, you can't go wrong with their pepperoni pizza (which is covered in tiny, crispy peps). But I recommend trying some of their more creative pies. My favorites are the R&B and the Grape & Gorgonzola which are both vegetarian. The Grecco salad with salty feta & olives, crunchy peppers, and that fresh basil vinaigrette is one of my favorite salads in the city! On Tuesdays they do a two for $25 deal that includes any pizza and any large salad. It's the perfect affordable date night and we often end up taking a couple slices home too. 

During COVID times they're offering patio dining and also online ordering for takeout. They have a great Instagram account that they use to post drink specials and new menu items so I recommend following. This spot is definitely worth a visit!",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He started his career at ""the Chili's"" on Greenville in Dallas. He taught me everything about the place. I bused tables, I washed dishes, I did prep work. He taught me to cut up the beef, and shuck oysters. I cooked and I waited a few tables, then I was Bar Back. A great friend named David Gruelich from Des Moines Iowa, who was then the bar manager, had to move back to Iowa for family reasons. After working for just a few months and just being 18 for just few days I lucked into being the bar manger. I had so much fun here and at Smugglers Inn throughout my college years. 

I tell this tell in relationship to ""the palace"" because throughout these years there always was a place that was talked of, that was dreamed of during these years and the years that followed. By those that were in ""the business"" Commanders Palace was ""the place"" to go. 

It's not just a place to go for some of the best food and service on the planet. It's more than that. It's  magical place where our collective culinary history of our fathers fathers can be present to our eyes ears nose and taste buds.

We were down there on a Saturday night and the area is very busy. I was thankful that S+S takes reservations because it was cold outside and by the time we got there we were only waiting 10 minutes. They had a line out the door waiting in the cold which tells me they are worth the wait.

The restaurant was very nice and modern. It has sort of an upscale feel without being over priced or stuffy. Their barbecue was amazing. We also really enjoyed the white cheddar mac with crackers. I would recommend skipping the fries because they were covered in garlic and almost inedible because of it. 

One other thing that was off was the children's menu. My daughter ordered the mac for her entree and for her side which is an option on the menu. The brought her two small dishes that looked like they would normally hold ketchup or something. When she spilled both out on her plate it came to about a half of up of noodles. It was such a tiny amount that it didn't seem normal. I asked someone if it was right and they said it was.. but then they did bring out an 'additional side' for her.. which was about 3-4 times the size of what she was originally brought. So she ended up having enough food it was just really odd. Not sure if it was a mistake or not. The kids meals were only like $5 or 6 I believe which is an awesome price.

We ordered cherry cokes and fully embraced the super cute decor which made us feel like we were in a retro diner and I should be wearing a poodle skirt and he a letterman's jacket.

We ate on the patio which they said will be opened three seasons. They're getting heaters and clear siding for the cooler fall days.

N0eI8Kd2TYNzlNCwjW8bUQ,3,"We decided to deviate from Texas Roadhouse and try this Outback. We started with the appetizer sampler. It came out with cold fries and cold/congealed cheese - inedible. It took 20 minutes just to get a beer after placing an order for one. Thankfully, we ordered our toddler's mac and cheese before placing our own orders. She was done eating an entire plate before we received our mostly brown lettuce Caesar salad. The salads sat to the side for another good 20 minutes after eating, not being checked on, before our food came. Because our baby started crying, we boxed up our dessert to bring home. Got home and found the brownie was burned. I mean, how many things can go wrong in one meal? From start to finish, with a simple order for two adults and a child, it took 1.5 hours (and that was rushing through eating our entree and taking dessert home). Not impressed - should have stuck to the Roadhouse. 

Update: the company very kindly sent a gift card after this review, so we gave them another try. Unfortunately, this particular outback just can't get it right. Our salads came before our app and my husband's steak tasted like fish because they ""may have grilled it where the salmon was"". I'm updating from 1 to 3 stars because our server was really great and took the fishy steak off the bill. So, service is very good, kitchen needs serious work.",-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

First, we had reservations and despite it not being busy at all we had to wait while watching other people be seated. MADE NO SENSE! There shouldn't have been a wait at all since we arrived right when they opened for dinner.

The experience can be a bit overwhelming. The buffet is delicious and has very unique and 'fancy' foods that you wouldn't find at a typical buffet. I filled up on the buffet alone. If I would have known there was an option to just get the buffet, then I would have done that, but of course no one told me that. 

The wait staff was very lackluster. They seemed like well-rehearsed robots, especially when explaining the concept of the restaurant. There's a way to add personality to even the most monotonous task...but they missed this memo. 

The meat that was brought to the table was alright, I guess. They give you a little sliver of each thing which is okay I guess since it's a buffet. After running from side to side of the restaurant, the meat was never warm. I have similar feelings with most buffets that it is pretty unsanitary and running around with my meat out in the open to each table for people to breathe on is pretty gross!

We had the same waitress as the 1st time and although I thought she was very nice, my husband told me about remarks she made that I didn't pay attention to.  We brought our own wine and apparently she was talking about our drinking, asking/laughing about who was driving home as well as other random comments about us drinking.  There were 2 of us drinking a bottle of wine, which we did not even finish (and she threw the cork out, so we couldn't even take it home if we wanted to), not that it was any of her business.  She is pregnant and said earlier in the evening how she can't have a drink for a few more months.

So, back to tonight's experience.  It is my birthday and I chose to go here because the food has been really good - and it was again.  As I said previously, we had a the same waitress and I thought she was OK, until the end of our meal.  Tonight I had 1 glass of beer, because we ordered a carafe of wine and it came out fizzy (like it was carbonated), so we didn't care for it and sent it back.  My husband had 2 glasses of a different wine.  We were getting ready to pay the check when she said with a laugh, ""I had to clean up so many glasses from you guys last time, I thought you were alcoholics"".  OMG - I almost fell off of my chair.  I didn't hear the 1st part of what she was saying, she was next to my husband, but I did hear the alcoholics part and said, ""What?  I only had 1 beer"" and was mortified.  She then went on to say that the last time we were there, she brought us several samples of wine and we told her that she had us confused with someone else, that we brought our own bottle of wine that time.  She asked if our younger son had an iPad with him last time and we told her no.  She said, ""Oh, I must be thinking of someone else"" and just laughed and walked away.

ic2m9WCBwrun_tcx7cTx4w,2,"My husband and I heard good things about this place, so we decided to have dinner here on a recent trip to Santa Barbara. The location was a bit far away from our hotel and the main drag (about a ten minute drive) but we were hoping that the food, service and atmosphere would make up for it. It did not. 
When we arrived for dinner around eight on a Sunday, we drove into a dark parking lot near the beach. The lack of street lights and signage made it a hard to find since we were unfamiliar with the area. 
We were greeted by friendly hostesses and seated inside right away. But then we waited for about ten minutes before a frazzled waitress came to our table and asked if we wanted drinks. It seems she was doing her side work and maybe wasn't expecting more tables? We ordered ice waters, appetizers and an entree to split as she hurried off, avoiding eye contact, to finish her work in the back. We saw her putting condiments in a rack and working with the busser while we waited for service.
About 15 minutes passed when we were served our seared ahi and shrimp cocktail by a different server. We still had no waters. The server rushed off before we could ask her for some. We waited to see if anyone would come by to check on us, or bring us water, but we were hungry so we dug in. The Ahi portion was incredibly small for the price but flavorful and good quality. The shrimp cocktail was good size but very bland, the shrimp had zero flavor and no seasoning whatsoever. It would have been great if they tossed it in a little salt, pepper and lemon juice before bringing it to us.
We also tried the clam chowder, it had big chunks of clam and potato, but also very very bland, it needed tons of salt and pepper so we loaded it up with Tabasco.
A couple was seated next to us and we overheard the waitress's telling them the specials and offering bread- we weren't offered either. Bread would have been nice with our chowder.
We shared the Macadamia crusted mahi for dinner my first bite was hot, but second bite was cold and mushy and the Mac crust was soggy. I didnt eat the rest of it. We piled our plates on the edge of the table and waited for someone to bring our check. 
We gave this restaurant two stars because the service was mostly friendly but terribly unattentive and the food was overpriced and mediocre.

Ambience: Very lively, lights are dim with candles on table. Bar area is pretty cool and has a little more lighting. Bar has a cool Oscar De la Hoya bike on display. Nice appeal! 

This place was popping for a Sunday!!! Live crowd, very trendy atmosphere. Very enjoyable if you don't mind a crowd.

Food Presentation: everything was pretty on a plate. No complaints in this area. Food was nice and hot!

Taste: First course--Shrimp Ceviche-chipotle citrus, avocado, and gooseberries... Nice taste w/ subtle kick of fire. Second Course--Chicken Tacos-chihuahua cheese, avocado, tomatillo and tomato salsa, crema... These were tasty, the tortillas were nice and soft and not drive. These definitely packed flavorful punch! Third Course--Carne Asada-grilled flat iron, cream corn and jalapeños, tomatillo escabeche... wasn't too impressed with the steak, it could've had a lot more flavor :-( however, the cream corn was pretty tasty!  

Server: Gabriel was awesome!!! Very knowledgable and made the experience fun. Loved the fact that he explained every dish that came out to the table. Food came out fast and hot. Drinks were refilled without having to ask.

Revisit: possibly, I've been to several Steven Starr restaurants and I like the experience and food so far!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

T6RBp_K18Bumpji-RVHAoQ,2,"Nama is visually appealing but far from a good sushi restaurant. Their menu is mainly focused on prepared foods, not fresh or raw foods that is considered typical sushi. 

I could not find a single roll that didn't have something cooked, fried, filled with cream cheese or made from artificial crab (they claim 50/50). To top it off my stomach has been in knots since I ate a $25 plate of sashimi on a bed of sticky rice. This would be the same raw fish you would find in nigiri or sashimi, just served as a featured dish. 

The appetizer sampler plate was worse than the dumplings and rolls that I get from the grocery store freezer isle.

ps9cTlXtekBDeL0-iBSGGA,5,"I was blown away at my experience at Garces Trading Company. 
Everything was amazing.

Here's my story. It was a Saturday and my crew and I went to the Rocky Steps which was a 20-minute walk from our hotel. Anywho, we climbed the top and they decided to stay back because they were in ""awe"" after reaching the top. (by awe I mean, winded from being out of shape)
Myself, as a student athlete decided to gets the steppin because I was so damn inspired by the view, so I jogged back to the hotel by my lonesome. Right when I got back in I looked at my sweaty face in the mirror and thought, ""Scotty, you're a beast, a wolf"". I spritzed some cologne and put on my deodorant and decided to get some quick takeout...........Let's just say my athletic stamina is a lot better than my sense of direction. I got lost and stumbled in here. Best stumbling experience ever!

I noticed the name Garces (from Food Network) and was like, dang.....he's the Iron Chef - Jose Garces!!!. So I walked in to get a seat, expecting to not be let in because I was a sweaty man-beast wearing a tank top (but I did smell nice) & right from the get-go, they took care of me!

I was greeted by a nice gentleman with long dark hair in a ponytail, really good guy. I told him I was a fan of Garces on Iron Chef and he answered lots of questions about the place. You can definitely tell that Jose Garces runs a great business, he was very enthusiastic about taking care of people and passionate about everything. I told him I was from Detroit and he was pretty cool about that. Great conversationalist.

The atmosphere was really nice. Nice wooden tables, nothing pretentious like marble plated tables with 24k gold lamps made from the Ark of the Covenant or anything, just a beautifully designed place to eat; a place where food is the star and not the decor. Loved it. 

The waiter was really helpful. I asked him for recommendations and he was very helpful. I was craving pasta and he said that his rankings are just like the order they are in on the menu. The pappardelle w/lamb ragu being the first on the list, followed by the carbonara, then the seafood one, then the lasagna in 4th. I took his advice and was ever-so pleased.
The service was top notch. Onto the food.

Minestra Soup - Lovely dish. It was very fresh. I eat soup 365 days a year & people be like, ""Yo G, soup in the summer?""
My answer is YES. The Minestra Soup at Garces Trading Co is the perfect summer soup. a beautiful broth of tomato and fennel with beans and fresh herbs and a few aromatic vegetables. In a way, it kind of reminded me of my mother's (r.i.p.) Tom Yum. You would have a nice crisp broth with perfect flavor was the foundation, but then you add the fresh herbs that unleash their flavoring as they get warmed by the heat. The textures in this one were amazing. Delicious broth perfect for soaking the nice bread they serve it with. A++

Pappardelle with Lamb Ragu - Great dish. The pasta here is ""Call ET"" out of this world good. Very fresh. Very rustic dish. Lovely, tasty, and warm.
I would describe this dish as comfort food overload. A beautifully meaty and savory experience. The fresh pasta grabs onto the meat juices like a perfect marriage. There are beautiful chunks of lamb. The meat is tasty and ever so tender; flavorful and gentle. The meat literally melts on the tip of your tongue as you chew the fresh peas and the perfectly cooked noodles which swam in a perfect sea of flavor, served just for you. 
I would describe this dish as the love child of my Aunt's Pot Roast & Thai Rard Na. What they have here is a beautiful dish. One perfect for carbo-loading before a game or unwinding & celebrating after.

I am very gracious that they let me come in looking like a savage, but they treated me no different.
I really felt bad about dining alone in a tank top, man, I was so embarrassed about being underdressed, but they took care of me anyway. In Detroit, places as nice as this wouldn't even give me a chance. Philly is a cool city and this place is one that makes it cool.

While I do feel bad for being underdressed, nobody treated me bad or any different because of it. I was treated the very same way as the table with 5 suits and dresses right to the left of me. 

For this, for the great staff, the cool atmosphere, for the amazing food, I give this place 6 out of 5 Yelp stars - it blew me away.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
RQ17K12tZjZN6dJIQqAABw,3,"Jackson's seems to be a college kid favorite. I've been there many a time and I have to say I do like their drinks, but the price is a bit much. They have a pomegranate margarita that has gotten me into trouble more than once though. The drink menu is very diverse that everyone can find something they like. 

As for the food, I've never been a huge fan. Their chopped salad isn't very impressive and their torrados (kind of like a wrap that's been grilled like a panini) always give me the impression they'd taste better without the grilling. All their ingredients seem to be high quality, I guess I just dislike their cooking styles. As a Cajun fan I was also very disappointed by their Gumbo, they say it has okra in it but I didn't notice and there wasn't any rice that came with it. My friends love their fried Twinkie dessert but I wasn't impressed. The Cookie-Dough Egg Rolls are fantastic though.

SlH7YIShlMq2ShHA4qABGQ,4,"I noticed that this restaurant opened up fairly recently near my jobsite. After several coworkers recommend the place I decided to check the place out.

First off the customer service, the lady behind the counter was extremely friendly. She was very helpful and attentive.Also the speed of the service was fairly quick.

The food itself was pretty good. It's your typical comfort food. The first time I went I had stewed chicken and it was fantastic! The sides I had were dirty rice and mustard greens,Those were also good. The next time I went I had hamburger steak with mash potatoes and gravy. Also I had a stuffed bell pepper. I ate every last morsel of that plate.

Now down to the nitty gritty details. This place is more geared for take out instead of dine in. They do have a few picnic tables just in case you want to eat there. This place has a few video poker machines in case you've been bitten by the gambling bug. Still I think the best aspect of this new business besides the food is the price! I was going to a place called ""Charlie's Restaurant"" just a few blocks from where I work. But after I tried the food here and paid less I decided that I want food from Stackers instead.

i5CstC14llAMJTah54xqLw,2,"Started out with the bone marrow appetizer. While I was honored that I got the last portion of bone marrow for the rest of the year, I didn't like it nearly as much as the bone marrow I've had at other places. There was a very prominent citrusy, lemony flavor that I thought interfered with the richness of the marrow itself. Also, to me, bone marrow is very much lifted by the carb you serve it with. Here, it was accompanied by a flaky, crumbly parsley biscuit that I don't think was conducive to sopping up the decadence of bone marrow.

For my main course, I got the pork chop, which was served with mashed potatoes and a mustard onions. The pork chop was thick and a beast to cut through and work with. A little tough on the outside but sadly seemed just a tad under cooked when I got to the center. The mashed potatoes were silky smooth but the mustard that the onions were coated in was really strong. Personally not a big mustard fan so that could've been toned down a tad for my tastes. 

For dessert it was the sassafras soft serve ice cream, which was like eating a root beer float almost. It was good, but not enough to give me warm fuzzies about Husk as a whole.

That was the first time I've seen that style of flight holder and i was impressed (it's the little things that get me. Lol).

I had always been told that the shanty was *the* place to go in town if you wanted to try a large variety of beers. If I remember correctly, they advertised the largest beer selection in town for a long time.

We dropped in after the street fair, and the place was empty. The bartender was plenty friendly, and was more than happy to give us the beer list and talk with us a bit, but the collection was, frankly, lackluster for my taste. They do have an extremely large variety of beers from around the world, but they all seem to be the most basic stuff you could get from each country.

What made things worse is that their beer menu lists: Country or state of origin and beer name. That's it. No style, no ABV, nothing beyond that very basic information. This was ultimately the biggest turn off for me.

Now, let me walk it back a little and explain that I found it difficult to rate Bindi as I kept wanting to review what I thought it should be and not what it is. Don't remember dish names, but do their descriptions; please excuse my ADD.

Love that it's BYO, since I'm notoriously cheapas... frugal. Just brought wine so can't review the mixers.

I had the tuna tartar, flatbread with honey (whatever this one's called) and the pork chop.

Yeah, I got a pork chop at an Indian place. Please bear with me, there's a good excuse: the server claimed it was the spiciest thing on the menu. It was beautiful, juicy, well crusted, and cooked exactly how I like it. The blanched veggies and potatoes went very well with it. Having said that though, if I were the type of guy that spends Saturdays eating cucumber sandwiches and shopping for bluchers, I'd have found this spicy. However wonderfully cooked the pork was, spicy it was not.

The tuna tartar was about what you'd expect, though I found the chippy things that come with it a little silly.

If I could fill a kiddie pool with the sauce that came with the flatbread though... that would be my kind of party. That stuff's crazy good and have no idea what's in it.

Everyone with me seemed to be very happy with their meals. Normally I'd try everything but the portions were generous enough that I was concerned enough with finishing my own meal.

Our server was very nice and knowledgeable.

The lighting was a little dimmer then I'd normally like, but would probably be just right for a date.

I would prefer more light on, but it's not my name on the deed. We had a few different servers that helped during our visit, they are all very fast and friendly. 

Kirin has a lunch sushi special. We each ordered that and split some of the rolls. For $11.75, you can pick 3 of the listed sushi rolls, along with a soup and a salad. We ordered the yellowtail, Alaska, spicy shrimp, spicy tuna, sweet potato and spicy crab. The soup and salad was the Asian restaurant usual, although the salad had a lot of dressing on it. 

The sushi came out fast. If you don't like much rice on your rolls, you'll like this sushi. The rolls had 8 pieces each, except for the yellowtail. I was impressed with the side of the yellowtail. It was a lot of fish for a roll. The sweet potato roll should've came with a warning, it was VERY hot. The spicy tuna is the minced kind, more like purée spicy tuna. I don't care for that because everything can become so mushy. The Alaska roll with salmon, avocado and cucumber had a better texture.

Not once did the server check on my meal, offer me dessert, nothing. Being that I'm on a work trip, I really was looking forward to this place but the overall lack of hospitality put a bad taste in my mouth. 

The fried chicken sandwich was good but messy. It was served on a cutting board and probably would have been better to have it in a shallow dish/bowl to catch the slaw that goes everywhere and the crumbles from the fried chicken. 

Pastries in the front looked great too, too bad the woman at the front when I was leaving (not the same person when I first came in) said goodbye without looking, smiling, nothing. Again, no thanks on the pastry then.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MG_QAGgpJ-sWo_8Ww6Rtog,5,"Thai Cuisine is my favorite Thai food in Boise.  Unlike Mai Tai, which I don't consider Thai, Thai Cuisine is authentic Thai food, nothing fusion about it.  The vegies are always fresh and crunchy, with consistent sauces and heat levels.  Two of five stars is considered medium hot, but three stars is still not very hot.  

It can't say enough good things about the servers.  They are so friendly and efficient and willing to explain any of the dishes.  Since the first time that we ate at Thai Cuisine, they always welcome us as returning customers and state how happy they are to see us again.

9EyQEghxnRwgTZ8NwyArQg,2,"Restaurant Review:

2 STARS

Huh? How have I not reviewed this place yet. Very odd, since I've been here a few times. Probably forgot to write a review because it was an easily forgettable experience.

The environment here is the best part. They have tried to be chic, modern, hip in the design of the restaurant. They did well with that. The parts where they are sorely lacking is the service and the food, which is the reason you come to a restaurant anyway, right? I don't come to eat crappy sushi but look at the wall and think ""Wow, that is a nice painting they have there on the wall"". Well, that's what happens here.

Last time I came with a few friends for later night sushi on a weekend. The service was horribly slow and it was not even very busy in there. We had to flag the waitress down everytime we wanted something. More water? Nope, you'll have to ask 3 times for that. Need more ginger with your sushi? Sorry for ya....

The sushi itself is okay, nothing that great. It didn't seem very fresh or flavorful to me. Not alot of care was put into making it, which was obvious. I have to say I actually like the ""fast food"" sushi from Rollbotto around the corner much better than theirs.

For what it is, Vue is a nicer place as to soak up the ambience of DTSP and grab a drink at the bar, but for sushi it's subpar. I take my sushi seriously, so in the future I'll go somewhere that serves up a decent roll.

Nightclub Review:
1.5 stars

I've been to the night club many times, but not by my own choice. Only because friends literally grabbed my arm and dragged me up here. The security guards waiting downstairs to permit you in the door and on the elevator up to the 19th floor are just plain annoying. Very pretentious. They act as if they are about to give you VIP access to the best club in the world (not true). Once you arrive upstairs and head to the big bar in the middle of the room, prepare to dump your wallet upside down and empty out a big amount of bucks for a weak, poorly made drink. Heck, even when I came here on ladies drink free night, I still couldn't stomach the screwdriver that they made. Blech. The crowd here is W-E-I-R-D. Bunch of WEIRDOs, seriously. Finally, the music usually stinks. Weird mix of top 40 and then some 80s songs thrown in occasionally, in which case the music is older than most of the patrons. The ONLY ( and I do mean ONLY) good thing about VUE 19 is of course the view from the top. You can see all of downtown and farther, which is a great view on a nice night. However, they don't let you bring drinks out there, presumably to prevent idiot patrons from throwing the glass over the side. So if you get a drink, you must finish it before you go outside. If you are a nightclub rat who loves to party anywhere, anytime, you may enjoy it; but personally this place is not my cup of tea. Plenty of better ways to spend a Friday night.",-1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

iRnFyOY0oakn-rbpwLKdew,4,"Stopped in at 1:30 AM on a Sunday when I was on the road. When I entered DINER into my GPS, this was the closest one to where I was. This is not in the best of neighborhoods IMHO, but hey, a girl's gotta eat. Looks a little dive-y from the outside, but I know, with diners, that can be misleading.

I was seated immediately although there was a crowd of people in the place (a diversity of age groups but mostly 20-somethings). The place wasn't particularly diner-like; more like a 1970s formica-topped-table & mismatched chairs type restaurant. But clean & friendly with heavenly smells, rotating dessert case & a bakery counter.

My hungry eyeballs brightened when I saw the menu. At the top it said, THE ORIGINAL GOLDEN DOVE DINER SINCE 1995! You know, old school. ;0)

Lots of selection here including all different kinds of breakfast (this place is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which I love!). I was feeling Italian food so I perused the choices. Lots of veal dishes with spaghetti. I thought, Hmmm, eggplant Parmesan? But they didn't have it.

Then I saw ""Veal Parmigiana Romano"" & was intrigued. It's a veal cutlet, breaded & fried, topped with ham, eggplant, & provolone cheese, with a side of spaghetti & tomato sauce (or gravy, if you're from Jersey). Lots of dishes on the menu noted that the dinners were ""complete."" Such a quaint 1950s word! I think that means you get soup or salad, the entree, & bread. My entree was $15.79.

I asked what the soup of the day was. Stephanie - who was a great waitress, friendly, bubbly & efficient - told me Italian Wedding or Chicken Noodle. I went with the former. She rushed me out my diet Coke.

Soon a little cup of soup - filled to overflowing - along with saltine crackers was placed in front of me. It wasn't Italian Wedding soup, which I consider to be oregano-flecked chicken broth base with tiny meatballs. This was minestrone, a rich vegetable soup with Italian flat green beans, tomatoes & elbow macaroni. I didn't really care & it was good! It didn't have a million chunks of potato in it which I consider to be a ploy by the restaurant to just fill up the soup bowl with something cheap. It was hot & good & tasted homemade.

I worry when I order veal at lower-priced restaurants (& some higher-priced ones; see my review of a German restaurant). I'm always worried I'm going to be served something that looks like the breaded bottom of my shoe. But I needn't have fretted at the Golden Dove because oh. My. GOODNESS this veal was good!

Stephanie brought me out this platter - yes, a platter, like one your mom would serve the pot roast on back when you were a kid - of food that was piping hot & smelled like a trattoria in Roma itself. I mean, this was a huge plate of food! The spaghetti's sauce looked better than jarred or restaurant distributor food sauce. And the veal.

Okay, it was a breaded, crispy-crusty piece of veal about the size of 2 decks of playing cards put side by side (yes, nice & thick too). This was fresh veal, not a chopped-and-formed ""cutlet"" from Costco. On top was a slice of deli-style sliced ham which had been frizzled separately on the grill (that made such a difference between a mediocre dish & a 4-star one). On top of that was a thin slice of fresh eggplant with the purple skin still on (nice presentation). That was topped with red sauce & provolone. The provolone was good-quality & was just right with the sweetness of the tomato sauce (the sauce was a bit too salty for me though, but I feel that way about most restaurant food).

One bite & I realized I'd made such a good choice! It really fed my soul. Stephanie checked on me & was good with the all-important after-entree-service followup & to refill my diet Coke. It bugs me when a server goes out for a smoke after they've carried out the entree & you don't see them again for 20 minutes.

I ate half my veal & half my spaghetti. I didn't get the bread that was promised by the word ""complete"" on the menu. I would have eaten it, but it didn't really matter. (But you should bring out the bread & butter, servers, even if it's not asked for.) Stephanie brought me out a box, a plastic bag, & the check (which I had called for).

Stephanie also told me that she had taken the job (her second) at the diner because she & her husband were trying to buy their first house. They wanted to settle by November 1, 2009 (which FYI is the deadline for first-time homebuyers to get a tax writeoff [thank you President Obama, I love you]). She said she had 2 kids - 4 & 2 - who really missed their mom when she was at work all night at the diner.

So if you're in the neighborhood, pop in & see Stephanie & OVERTIP! Tell her Kathie (the first person to order the Veal Parmigiana Romano on her shift, she will remember) sent you!

Altogether my bill was $21.88 ($17.88 + a $4 tip). I wanted dessert, but I had to get home & it was late! Or early! But my belly was full & my soul fed. Thank you, weird computerized woman's voice on my GPS!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

i have never seen smoke in there...that might have been before, but i didn't see anyone smoking

as for crowded, yea, i have seen lines out the door...i went this past Sunday at noon and it was half empty though...so like said, avoid the rush...even with the rush, the service is so quick that you can be in/out within 20 minutes....

so bottom line...a pancake is $3...a large chocolate milk is $2....that combination will leave you completely full...you get a pancake that is ridiculously huge and perfectly cooked...i uploaded a picture...we got 2 eggs, toast, bacon, one chocolate chip pancake, and a large chocolate milk for right at $10...it was at our table within 5 minutes of ordering it...

so...i guess the only thing that i think sucks is the wait time...but that could be solved with a bigger building...otherwise, they would have to overprice their food or degrade the quality...it is what it is there...a tiny breakfast joint with quick service, cheap food, and the best pancakes out there...i don't think they go for anything more than that...",1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

oCZK5SHeHAkbW3s07pw3vw,1,"Pretty disappointed by my latest experience at Green Eggs Cafe. Don't get me wrong, I love this restaurant and will definitely return but this is my first bad experience. I ordered something simple, creme brulee french toast and a side of grits with the scrapple chips. I was told a 15 min wait for the food. After 15 mins had gone by and still no food, I didn't mind waiting longer because they were super busy for the holiday. During my wait I seen people who ordered after me at the counter get their food. I guess they don't cook by order number, maybe they do the dine in orders first before take out. I don't know. After a long wait of at least 40 mins I am handed a bag that was most likely sitting there for a while. If my order was done, I should have been informed immediately. But, they have the same person working take out and the counter for dining in. I checked the food in my car and it was FREEZING COLD. I literally only walked from the restaurant to my car parked in front. I couldn't believe it. Instead of going back into the crazy busy restaurant and waiting another 40 mins for food, I took it home to eat. The food was horrible. My creme brulee french toast was not garnished properly and it didn't have any vanilla anglaise on it. The grits were inedible. Seriously, they were hard, clumpy, and gritty. I had to throw them away. I am not satisfied at all with Green Eggs Cafe today. In the future, please check all of your take out orders before leaving the restaurant.

Well, if you have not tried Fresh Kitchen you should.  I selected the 6 bowl feeling I could have more than one meal from the bowl.  
I was allowed two basses in which I selected the kale salad and sweet potato noodles.  I am truly the visual person when it comes to food.  But, in the end,​ it needs to taste just as delicious as it looks.
The sweet potato noodles just glistened in the container.  They appeared to be silky and were​ just that as you eat them.  
The meal came with two veggies​: I selected the roasted sweet potato and the parmesan broccoli.​    The sweet potatoes were just the right size and had that familiar sweet taste.  The broccoli was a bit too salty for me.
The meal also came with two proteins​: ​BBQchicken​e​, and grilled citrus chicken.  One of the chickens they had burnt​t which left a terrible taste in your mouth.
I also purchased a portion of salsa which had like a vinaigrette​ on it.
I ended up getting two sauces which were favorable.  Holy kale and creamy white ginger.

I was with a group of three, we were seated immediately. The entire time we were there (mind you we got there at six), we were the only people there the entire experience. It freaked me out too because there wasn't music playing. 
You would expect a restaurant to be near full or at least close to capacity between 6-7PM? Whatever. 
We started with the nachos and added pork. They were good- we finished the plate. It was Taco Tuesday so all of the tacos were half off! The tacos come in twos I believe and they are a la carte. I ordered the shrimp tacos! They were great! I feel like Florida kind of sucks at the whole Mexican taco game (which is weird because of where Florida is on the map) but these tacos hit different. The shrimp was cooked to perfection; seasoned and juicy and HOT. I LOVE when my food comes out hot but you'd be surprised how often it doesn't (LOL). They also warm the tortillas and I believe mine was finished on the grill because it hard that warm crunch to it. Not a crunch even... it just crisps up the shell enough to where it doesn't get too soggy!

Anyway, big whopping slices of pizza. And my sausage calzone was tasty. Oozing with cheese and baked perfectly brown. The sausage was a little bland, but otherwise good.

Now, I'm originally from the Chicago suburbs, and while this isn't exactly the way deep dish is served at home, it gets the job done when you have a craving for it. And their salads are SO good here.

Ordered 2 Jumbo cheesesteaks and I explained to the clerk (who looks like she broke out of a jail). She doesn't understand me what I wanted exactly ( first  jumbo with onions and extra cheese and the second jumbo, half with no onions and extra cheese). Still confused, so I drew a picture to explain what I want on the second. Finally got it. However the preparer didn't get it. Gave me without extra cheese that I paid $2 more for each Jumbo.  So they fixed it and charged me $34.91. I gave them $5 coupon I located on my iPhone.  No problem.   The chsk tastes wonderful with the 4 stars, but their tables are dirty and there are shipment cartons all over the place. 1 star on appearance and nearness. Not neat looking place to sit down to eat but good enough for take-out. That's why I'm being fair to improve their rating from 1 star to 3 stars after 2 years later.

The cheese was stiff.  The calling card for this product is hot and freshly made.  Why?  Can I get my money back?  I could not return it.

My friend ordered the much talked about red velvet pancakes, which was pretty much a 3 layer sheet cake smothered in syrup. That thing was massive, probably enough to serve a family. It was delicious and super fluffy, but way to much sugar for a brunch item. It's definitely meant to be shared. It'll be great if they offer a smaller version for a portion of the cost because 3 layers seemed kind of excessive.

We went inside and the place was packed! Now, this was on a Saturday afternoon - so I am sure that is a rush hour time for them. The d√©cor was fantastic - they had little squeaker chickens in a cage up on the ceiling, license plates all over the walls, a huge frog resting on the metal side of the wall. Honestly, it's ugly as can be - but it's 'DOWN HOME' look gives you plenty to look at while you wait for your food and the little handwritten quotes all over the walls from Uncle Bud are hilarious. (My favorite? ""People keep saying that women wear less clothes now than they did fifty years ago. Well, that's not true. They wear the same amount of clothes, just not at the same time."" Haha!)
 
We were seated immediately and our server came over to greet us on the spot. She gave us our menus as well as a ""Experience Rating"" sheet that was essentially a full one-page questionnaire that asked about our experience with the food, service staff, etc. It mentioned that we could give our review to the hostess at the front of the restaurant after the meal and be registered to win a giftcard! I think this is a brilliant idea for restaurants because I'm certain it is more likely to keep the service staff ""in check"" on making sure their customers are happy.
 
Our server was as sweet as can be - she brought our drinks out immediately in these huge mason jars before she told us that she was going to get our ""fixins."" The fixins come with every meal (kind of like tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant) and include coleslaw, pickles, onions, white beans, and hushpuppies. Everything was incredible! The hushpuppies were piping hot and the beans had bits of bacon/ham in them - incredible flavor.

I ordered the ""Catfish & Chicken Combo"" and my friend ordered the ""3 Fillet Dinner."" The portions were huge for the price! By the time you fill up on the fixins and your meal, you have at least a full meal ready to take home. The catfish beat any catfish I have ever tried in my life - it just flaked perfectly. The chicken was tender and only included good cuts - no gristle or hard ends.
 
The only thing I didn't like about Bud's were the biscuits - this is the south and we are known for having amazing biscuits! These seemed like plain old Pillsbury canned biscuits. HOWEVER, in an effort to make them taste better, I added some of their Roddenberry's Cane Patch Syrup and let me tell you.. that was the BEST syrup I have ever had in my entire life. It wasn't the kind that you would put on pancakes - but almost had a sorghum consistency to it. Delicious.

The quality of sushi here is surprisingly high; the rolls are packed tight with large amounts of fresh fish and toppings, and the sushi rice is properly seasoned and only minimally applied so as not to interfere with the flavor of the rest of the roll. The sushi lunch combo gets you two rolls for $9 and comes with a soup or salad, both of which are quite nice; the salad dressing is ginger based and comes with a variety of nice greens, while the miso soup has a nice, predictable flavor.

The bento was quite nice as well. I ordered the grilled salmon bento, which came with a lightly seared piece of salmon that was slightly crisp on the outside, yet moist and flavorful on the inside. The accompanying parts of the bento were equally tasty and enjoyable.

The only major downside of this restaurant is that I never feel entirely full after I finish my meal. The two sushi roll combo is relatively expensive for how hungry you feel after, and adding a roll would cost an additional $4 to $5.

Their original margarita the Distrito is as good as it gets in the margarita world.  We ate here during University City Dining days so we got to try mini versions of the appetizers and entrees.  Sadly the dessert was mini as well.  

The guacamole is literally the best guac i've ever had- a must try for sure!  I also got the enchilada and I wanted the squash quesadilla but they were all out so i got the mushroom flatbread instead.  The mushroom flatbread was amazing; the enchilada was a little spicy which i don't particularly care for.  I don't eat meat but I heard my boyfriend saying that he thought the octopus was the best. 

For dessert I got the miniature version of their chocolate flan...it was so good my only complaint is it was literally bite size; smaller than those mini muffin things.

hjtMojmaXZqJdJxj5RiOOQ,4,"I was introduced here on high recommendation from my dance partner and had the wonderful opportunity to have dinner here with her and my uncle.

There are a variety of dishes available but the key ingredient is that all food is eaten with the hands. Each dish is served family style in the center with bread also known as Injera (made of teff) served in the center in a large bowl for everyone to take food with. Small chunks of bread are ripped off of this main pancake shaped piece of bread to use as dipping devices to scoop up the food which is served in large globs family-style in the center of the table.

The bread is moist and spongy and is gluten-free so very healthy.  The bread is called Injera and is a traditional flatbread that accompanies every meal and is traditionally always served cold.

While there were many dishes to be had the highlights of the menu are as follows:

Samosa: A fried or baked pastry with savory filling such as spiced potatoes onions peas in this case lentils and also minced meat sometimes pinenuts. Samosas originated in Central Asia.

Kitfo: Beef tartare seasoned with herbal butter red pepper and cardamom it can be ordered rare, medium or well-done. We ordered it rare because the rareness of the beef as a silky texture which is very nice. It was a bit too spicy for me however. 

Gomen wot: collard green stew. Served with two veggie sides.

Veggie combo: choice from five veggie dishes including spicy split lentil stew, yellow peas, collard greens steamed cabbage, Ethiopian salad chick peas in spicy sauce and green beans with carrots. Steamed cabbage and lentil dishes were extremely tasty.


I had to subtract one star however due to the overall spiciness of the food and subsequent gastrointestinal upset. We ordered toned down versions of the food as far as spiciness goes and it was still a bit too much for me. However, I am a wuss. Well I don't think anything was inherently wrong with the cooking it is unusual and if not  eating regularly can cause some upset.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This restaurant has three major part of menu - the tempura, sushi sashimi, and teriyaki. They also have the rice and noodles bowl section. They have offers the variety of sushi. I always like their bento boxes and the boxes are the best values. They have teriyaki, sashimi, and tempura bento boxes. 

Today I have the sashimi bento box with added shrimp tempura for extra $3. I love shrimp tempura. The correct way is slight dip the shrimp in wet bread and deep fried. Then drip a bit of tempura next to shrimp and create the crispy effect. However, this process needs to finish in less than 3 minute before over cook the shrimp. This restaurant has the technique for it. The box came with 9 pieces sashimi, cucumber salad, tuna roll, California roll, and imitations crab salad. The sashimi is fresh. Love the shrimp tempura.

I had the spicy Tan Tan Men which was served with a Shoyu Tamago which is my favorite addition to any Ramen bowl. Not sure what it is? Shoyu Tamago is a soft boiled egg that has been soaked in a mix of soy sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar. It is the perfect pop of salt and umami for your ramen. The Tan Tan Men in general was spicy, as advertised, and the pork was ample and delicious.

I finished my lunch off with a little treat of red bean mochi, my favorite Japanese desert. The outside of the mochi was delicate and gummy and the filling was the perfect balance of red bean and sweet. I will definitely get this again!

MqpIdPsUJHAHebGUjuf9Ng,5,"This is another amazing restaurant that I never would have tried if not for Yelp. The outside of Simply Delicious is very kitschy and you may even wonder whether or not the place is open or still there. When you walk in the entrance (which is on the backside of the building), your mind will be blown. It is really nice on the inside! It has an old (very clean) black, white and red New York dinner feel to it. There are old Broadway posters framed on the wall and they even have a small brick wall with barbed wire fence at the top in one section of the restaurant. The decor is fantastic. 

On to the food. My eyes grew big as I read the menu. This restaurant is definitely more than just a New York Deli. They have stuffed cabbage, meatloaf and much more. We were in the mood for burgers. I was very pleased that their menu had a full page of burgers. I was having a hard time deciding on what to get when my eye caught one word: Latke (which is a potato pancake if you are not familiar with the term). They had a burger with Latkes instead of bread! Done. My Husband opted for the Simply Delicious with bacon (a double cheeseburger) and we both paid an extra 99 cents for fries with our meal. 

When our burgers arrived they looked and tasted just as good as they sounded. The Latkes were really hot to pick up, but they were delicious. Definitely the best Latkes I have had. They had some sort of herbs and seasonings mixed in for an excellent flavor. It went really well with the burger. My Husband loved his burger too and was happy that they actually cooked it medium rare (most places cook it well done when he orders it medium rare). We liked it so much that we ordered deli sandwiches to go for work later that night (which were piled high and some of the best deli sandwiches we have ever had). 

Simply Delicious is definitely budget friendly too. They have dinners that are 2 for $20 (including the mentioned meatloaf and stuffed cabbage). They also have really great specials everyday of the week. I am uploading a picture I took of the specials. 

We will definitely become regulars at Simply Delicious. While the name does not fit the decor; it definitely describes the food.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

#NAME?,2,"My Boyfriend and I are huge sushi fans and wanted to try out a different place, so we decided on Sushi Pier 2.  I believe we showed up around noon and there was only a handful of customers in the place.  We were greeted and sat quickly at the bar.  Our drink order was taken promptly and brought to us in a timely manner but, that's about all I can say was good about the experience.  Our server for our drinks never came back over to refill our ice teas or waters, he was too busy with some friends who sat at the other end of the bar.  We had to ask the bus boy for a refill everytime and I really  wanted to tip the bus boy not or server.

I let it go thinking that it was just a mistake and the next order would be better.  Boy was I right, it was even bigger and again made me gag.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt we ordered a couple long rolls and the same thing happened, we couldn't fit the pieces in our mouths and I again gagged. Finally we ordered a couple of their House Specials to see if they could get these right  the Mikey Mouse and the Donald Duck. Nope  they didn't, way too much rice with HUGE pieces of fish topped with way too much crab and drowning in sauce. I tried to bite this thing in half and after realizing that that was impossible just went for it and agian was gagged horribly.

Maybe I should make a list of all the bars who never clean their lines out. That might be a tall order around here though.

My burger came out after a medium wait. The fries were crisp, some a little too crisp like they'd been sitting in the frier a little too long. The burger itself was cooked ok on the outside and the cheese was melted in. Unfortunately they undercooked it again. Medium does not mean medium rare. If I see much more than a little pink, that's NOT medium. I ended up eating the burger because I was starving. Bad decision. In the middle of the night I woke up and had some problems.

Ia-y_VeRXxziazl1XtEIrw,2,"I stopped by the restaurant solo on a Thursday night. I sat at the bar and waited for about 5 minutes for the bartender to notice me. It was odd because their were 5 other people at the huge bar. The interior is quite nice with windows all around the room and a lot of light. The bar stools were magnificent! They are solid, sturdy, and large enough for a tall man to be comfortable. The bartender finally came over and I told him I would be eating and drinking. He supplied me with a placemat, and three menus. One was for food, one was for drink, and the other was for the raw bar. When I walked in they have a cold case with three oyster varieties, two clam varieties, and lobster. The menu I got for the raw bar was different than the case. I ordered the clams on the half shell and didn't get the ones that I ordered, but they were delicious anyway! 

I did order beer off the can menu because the draft beer was not my taste. Ken was the bartender and although he was very nice he did mess up my drink order, as well as several other patrons. He also was not trained on the menu which I found odd. The second time I went to the bar, there was no menu and the bartender told me to choose something I like. I found this odd since I didn't remember what they had and wanted a list of beers to choose from. The bartender was Kim and she was nice, but extremely overwhelmed. They were training someone who was equally friendly, but who had no bar tending experience. I found this odd also for a place as high end as this. 

The food I ordered the first time consisted of the raw clams, which were delicious, and the octopus, which was good, and the lobster roll, which was awful. I was disappointed in the lobster roll as it was not worth the $18 price tag. It was limp, heavily buttered lobster meat on a soggy roll. I stick to the front side of the menu where things are tasty and affordable. On the back side you can order an $87 steak. Yeah, I don't see the point of that either...

The second time we ordered all off of the raw bar menu and the shellfish was good, but, here is what really bothered me: We ordered a sampler, which is every raw fish offered, for $26, and it came short one clam. I mentioned it to the server and they said, they ran out of the second type of clam. SO, I paid for two because no one adjusted the price, but got one, and it never occurred to the kitchen to serve two clams of the same type to fill the order. I was disappointed in this especially because our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. Our entire evenings food took over 30 minutes to get to us. All we ordered was appetizers...

The service is slow here. The manager apparently walked out recently so they have no one running the show. To cap it all off, our bill came the second trip and we were charged for drinks we didn't have. I just wanted to get home so we paid regardless. 

I will leave it at this. I like the decor, I like the bar, and I like that it is 5 minutes from my house. It is very poorly run, understaffed and under supplied.

kcFKu73hK_Y3h3xXYgxzcQ,2,"ON a recent evening, my dinner companion remarked, ""Pietro's is a decent feeding trough.""  He may have meant that as a compliment, but I believe that I speak for both of us when I say that the positives stop there.  The marks of a feeding trough are often similar:  run by a company that owns several restaurants (check); efficient seating system, even on a crowded night (check), attentive wait staff (check); efficient kitchen, food brought out quickly (check); bill is correct and served promptly (check).  It passes the feeding trough test.  

But moving on to the food that I ordered and partially ate:  I feel that this restaurant is lacking something.  I ordered a wine-braised beef short rib on a bed of risotto, which was one of the most expensive item on the menu (you can imagine I did not do this lightly.  Or maybe I did.) The name of the game is good food, not acceptable service.  

Starting from the bottom up:  the bed of risotto.  It was dry, and bland.  The center of the entree, the short rib, was not particularly tender, and overwhelmingly salty.  It was also a bit dry.  It tasted like a salty pot roast, not a braised beef short rib.  I've had the exact same dish many other places.  I know what good risotto tastes like, and what a good short rib is.  These are not hard things to master.  And for the price, I expected this to be something more on par with a higher end restaurant.  It wasn't.  I didn't finish.

We also ordered the Caprese, which was fine, but nothing special.  It was fine, but I'm not going to compliment the fact that you sliced some tomatoes and put some mozzarella on top.  

All in all, good service, but lackluster food for the price.  If you need to be in and out in a hurry, this is your place.",-1.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0

If you order over easy eggs you are going to get scrambled, want a side of bacon? They will bring you ham, all while grimacing and looking miserable ringing you up and bringing your food to your table.

 I started ordering food from them with sbmenus and it is always a surprise to see what they messed up next. If I ordered a side of soup it would either be forgotten, or I would have salad with no dressing thrown in. Then when I would call to explain their mistakes, they would tell me to take it up with sbmenus, even though they were the ones who got my order and were in charge of packing the food, and even with my phone calls the problem persists. At this point I feel like they are doing it on purpose, is it really that hard to double check an order before handing it to sbmenus?
 I thought maybe I was just experiencing their off days, but when I went in the other day I realized I was wrong.

 I went in to pick up some of their yummy and adorable Peace cupcakes because my boyfriend loves them, and a lady was ordering in front of me. She had a very simple order- two of the same cupcakes, yet the girl packing them up asked her over and over again what she wanted. I was perplexed, even more so when she did the same thing to me when I ordered 1 cupcake. I decided to go to the food area and order one of their amazing coffees called ""Angeleno"" and when I did the lady at the counter scoffed at me, and when I said ""thanks!"" gave me a dirty look.

 Despite this terrible service, I went back again the next week and almost lost it when I ordered their classic cafe breakfast, as I have probably 20+ times, and the cashier rolled her eyes and started to argue with me and tell me I was ordering incorrectly, and then corrected herself and didn't apologize.

The dining area is just one large room, with lots of luchador memorabilia, masks, flags, and bright colors everywhere. The restaurant is organized to feel a bit empty (I think they could comfortably fit one or two more tables in the center of the dining area) but it's a plenty comfortable place to eat with plenty to look at if your date isn't as interesting as you hoped.

The service was good, nothing too special but we got what we ordered quickly, and our waitress answered all the questions we had about the menu. She even helped my little sister (11 yo) decide what to order.

The food was all pretty tasty. We started with the chips and queso, which is not something our family of health conscious people would usually get, but it was an absolute hit. For mains, I got the Mole Poblano (I'm a sucker for a good Mole), my sister got fajitas, and my mom got the taco salad. This isn't the best Mole in town but it's up there. The fajitas and taco salad were reported as being very good as well, and in impressively large servings. The drinks were also pretty good. I had two margaritas, which aren't usually my favorite drink, but I rolled with the environment and ended up very pleased.

Finally, the pricing is incredible. You get a good amount of food, and for the most part a single dish is going to be under $10. That's pretty hard to beat, though I guess that should be expected for a downtown restaurant. Still, definitely not complaining here.

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($6) - Water chestnuts, onions, lemon grass, Thai Basil, cilantro. I've only ever had chicken lettuce wraps once before and that was at PF Chang's. I thought these were good.

Pan-Seared Potstickers ($6) - Served with seasoned dipping sauce. I don't normally order potstickers. These look beautiful and we're good quality but it was the least interesting menu item for both of us. We would not order them again.

Korean Cauliflower ($6) - Roasted cauliflower, Korean glaze, gochujang aioli. This was a knockout dish. It was our favorite appetizer. 

Crispy Crab Wontons ($6) - Served with sweet chili dipping sauce. I don't normally order crab wontons but I could tell that these had real crab. Crab with melted cream cheese isn't really my thing, but if this is an item you like, I would recommend trying it here.

General Ling's Chicken ($16) - Crispy chicken, green onions, red bell peppers, carrots, Thai Basil, sweet and spicy soy. I expected this dish to be a bit more like General Tso's chicken. It's completely different and less spicy than I had expected, but it was my favorite of the two entr√©es. I would order it again.

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - Crispy shrimp, broccoli, mushrooms, candied walnuts, honey sauce. I don't care for sweet entr√©es, so this isn't the kind of dish I would normally order. It's only the second time I've ever had it. I thought it was good though.

Uncle Fu's Fried Rice -Combo ($15) - Chopped vegetables, scrambled egg, secret sauce with chicken, shrimp, pork tenderloin and flat iron steak. We would have ordered the pork fried rice but we were told the pork had a sweet flavor. The combo version of this dish was good but the meat had been marinated and was a tad on the salty side for me. Next time I'll try it with just the pork.

Banana Caramel Spring Roll ($9) - Banana cheesecake, fresh strawberries, banana mascarpone, vanilla bean ice cream. This is a great dessert and perfect for sharing.

Ling & Louie's is not a traditional Chinese restaurant, but it knocks most of the competition out of the water. In addition to great food, we received excellent service and the ambience was lovely.

If you need any more incentive to try this restaurant, they now serve brunch on the weekends and children ages 12 and under eat free on Sundays.

EBctf2qVF83BjL8eQFfDmA,5,"IndeBlue has been on my radar for a bit now, and it did not disappoint.  We entered the sleek, clean restaurant and were quickly shown to a table right next to the open kitchen.

We asked the server to suggest a couple different naan options since there were a lot of choices.  He offered up their traditional bread and another that was cheese-filled.  We also ordered samosa, which I approached with some hesitation because of a past bad experience.  Turns out, the Rutgers dining hall wasn't doing it right.  These samosa  had a spicy, delicious filling inside a tender, flaky crust.  I could have eaten more, but thankfully our dinners came out quickly.

Our dining companions each ordered lamb dishes.  They loved them, but I declined a taste since they ordered them hot and I am a heat wuss.  My husband and I went simple and decided to settle the age-old argument:  Which is better?  Chicken Makhani or Chicken Tikka Masala?

The verdict: they are both equally amazingly saucy and flavorful when you order them at IndeBlue.  

I would have loved to order some dessert, but alas, we were all too stuffed, what with our meals, our appetizers, and the second basket of naan we had them bring out.  No biggie, though.  I'll definitely be back.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

puDn3xLi_6j_OPtBn1mqow,5,"I agree with a previous review that ""Bittercreek is absolutely and undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in town."" The food and service are fabulous, and the prices are cheap. I don't mean relatively cheap, I mean they're cheap and you get QUALITY food.

Everything I have tasted from the menu has been absolutely delicious and very well priced.  I can't personally rave about the beers but they've got an amazing selection. I've also ALWAYS had superb service here; the staff knows the menu well and are able to articulate why they like an item, as opposed to saying ""it's good."" I've never had to wait to be greeted nor have I had a long wait for the food. 

As an added bonus, the food comes from local farmers! I'm a fan of eating local, especially when it is made in to the delicious food offered at Bittercreek. 

Some items I LOVE:

House salad: no iceberg in sight.

Tomato Basil soup: not chunky, well seasoned, fresh tasting

Spicy Lamb Burger:  (favorite of my fianc√©) 
Bittercreek BLT: it's huge, the bacon is thick cut and flavorful and no extra charge for the avocado! Yum.

Chicken pesto sandwich thing - I don't see the specific item on the e-menu, but there's a chicken pesto sandwich made on focaccia and thing that is unique and flavorful. It's hard to stop eating it.

Steaks -I think I had one from the specials menu. It was tender, flavorful, and perfectly medium rare. It came with some sort of friend onion or green bean swirls on top, saut√©ed veggies... and something else. Only downside was undercooked green beans.  :-/",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Lots of sweet large chunks of meat on a perfectly toasted split down the middle hot dog roll. No extra crap on it like mayo celery just like in Maine. People have complained that the price is high. Go into town and pay 2x more for something not as nicely crafted. 

The lobster grilled cheese was good, not greasy with some nice chunks of meat inside. My wife who is not a lobster fan enjoyed her perfectly grilled dog. At $4 that may have been on the expensive side. The lobster bisque was tasty but could have used a bit more meat. Also was only warm, the fellow at the counter said they were having trouble with the soup warmer. The Mac and cheese was also good and cheesy but at $4.95 also expensive for the size.

Everything was so salty I couldn't eat much. So we were told maybe it was extra salty that day. OK I'm always up to give a business a second chance. 

We went to try again and ordered the fried mushrooms and grouper dinner. We did ask and the grouper was frozen, however I believe there is still a ban from fishing grouper, although I'd prefer fresh....Understandable! But, here we go again with the heavy heavy salty batter. It irritated my stomach so horribly. The rice was inedible to the point where it was completely hard and not cooked at all. The beans tasted as if they'd sat in a hot crock pot for 3 days. The oil tasted old with a burnt flavor. 

I'm not so sure I'm understanding why people speak so highly of this place. We sat in the bar and had phenomenal service! We didn't complain because we were so hungry and just wanted to eat!

We started off with some beet salads and mussels which were both very good and decent portions. For our main course we ordered the white truffle mushroom pizza and a half meatball half roasted veggie pizza to split between 3 people. I don't really prefer white pizzas or mushrooms too much so my review is based solely on the red pizzas. I do wish they used more tomato sauce  but the meatballs were good and they didn't skimp on the veggies.

For dessert we had coffee and a scoop of the chocolate gelato. The gelato was more icy than creamy but had a strong flavor. The gelato came with an almond biscotti which is nothing special.

vZ3B8iGzMcJMT5GkKpnVKg,5,"Hands down the best meal that we've had in New Orleans. This restaurant lives up to all the hype and its 5-star reputation. 

Let me first applaud the service at Commander's Palace. Allow me to point out some of the basics: my water glass was always filled and when the ice cubes melted, they took my glass away and gave me another glass of fresh ice water with another plate of fresh lemon slices too...very attentive and detailed service. Also, our dishes were always brought to us and taken away in a synchronized fashion, which showed that the staff is very well trained. Additionally, everyone was very friendly and professional and answered all the questions we had. 

Now, after studying their menu, we thought the food here is very reasonably priced given the setting. Comparing to the prices NY high-end restaurants charge for dinner, this is actually on the cheap end. We went with the 3-course meal selections and opted for the Gulf Fish (i.e. the red fish) and Shrimp & Grits. For soup & salad, I ordered the tomato salad and my husband went with the gumbo. For dessert, we both had the bread pudding. In addition to the 3-course, we also ordered two appetizers: the Lafourche Surf n' Turf and Shrimp & Tasso Henican. (yup, we can eat!) 

The Gulf Fish was very similar to the blackened red fish I've had at another restaurant, but the presentation was a lot better with cute little veggie sides. Nothing too special, but still good nevertheless. The Shrimp & Grits on the other hand was the best I've had; granted I've only had shrimp & grits twice in the South, but trust me when I tell ya this dish is delicious and I highly recommend it if you're in for a southern experience. As for the Gumbo, to me, it's not spicy enough, but still decent. The tomato salad was amazing though; very refreshing and the tomatoes were fresh, sweet and juicy. As for the appetizers, we loved their surf & turf! Now it's not the usual steak and lobster that we're used to. Instead, it's fried oysters and pork belly. What an interesting and delicious combo! Their fried oysters were meaty and crispy with thin breading. The root beer braised pork belly was extremely flavor with the crab boil corn pudding as sauce....oh boy, that was just fantastic and definitely a highlight of the meal. Another highlight was our dessert; their bread pudding is a must try. It's not really the usual bread pudding you have in mind. Here I will not mention much details, but definitely do give it a try and you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. 

Unfortunately, there was a part of our dining experience that I was a little upset about. After the appetizer and soup/salad, we had to wait about 25 minutes for our entrees. We saw entrees been brought up to other tables (who definitely ordered after us) and just waited and then waited more. At 20 minute mark, I called our waitress and asked her to check on our order. 5 minutes later, still no food. I then asked for the manager to come over to our table. The manager politely apologized and within the next minute or so, our food is here. Surprisingly when we got our bill at the end, it was so cheap that we had to stare at it for a couple more seconds; our entrees were taken off the bill. I guess the manager waived it as an apology for the wait. Another demonstration of their outstanding service and how funny that the best meal on our trip just became the cheapest meal, amazing. 

Oh last but not least, their garlic bread is also hot and delicious. Can't have enough of those but had to stop myself from asking for more to have enough room for the main course. LOL.

uaXw2wzVS23A52LrVN-rlg,5,"Pizza Squared is a Detroit-style pizza place conveniently located right off of I-275 and near Busch Gardens. The restaurant is more suited for take-outs--the kitchen and counter take up most of the restaurant. In the remaining space, on one side is a row of chairs (presumably for people waiting for their take-outs), and on the other side are two tables--one 4-person table and one longer table for about 12 people. Because my co-worker and I visited during our lunch hour, we were short on time and called ahead. The restaurant took about 20 minutes to prepare an 8-square, mushroom and onion pizza--not bad. The pizza was everything my co-worker promised and more. The bread was perfectly toasted with a soft, gooey inside and a slightly burnt, crispy outside. The onions and mushrooms were slightly burnt (tasty!) but juicy. The entire pizza was covered in cheese and dollops of rich tomato sauce. I still say Eddie & Sam's is the best pizza place in Tampa, but mainly because I prefer the NY-style pizza over the Detroit-style pizza. For Yelpers, I recommend making use of Pizza Squared's offer--one free can of soda or a dollar off of your order. Also, because the restaurant charges 8.99 + 1.00/topping for a 6-square pizza and 12.99 + 2.00/topping for a 8-square pizza, per square, ordering the 8-square pizza is cheaper than ordering the 6-square pizza.

Upon our seating, our very nice server sold us on the 6 course Pre Fix. Neither of us had much of an idea of what to order or expect. We have had poor experiences with Indian Food in the past, however we wanted to try at a higher level of eatery before we closed the doors forever to eating this type of food. 

I think the quality of the ingredients, the staff, the portions, the ambiance was top notch.
The other person joining me loved the meal. But for a few exceptions, Please understand, I realize there is a difference between a quality meal which this was, and me just hating the tastes. I'll list the courses. And my ending of this challenging meal.

Started with some sort of cold soup. - to me it was ok. The other person said it tasted like vomit.
Fried Spinach Salad - Fantastic texture and taste! Simply marvelous, Both of us loved it.
Seared Scallops,- Over cooked by a hair, not seared properly. Very sweet Sauce inedible. The other person liked it. Here take mine.
Lolly POP of a Lamb Rib with a Small Chicken Breast. - To me inedible, tangy and very spicy. Chicken was in a spicy Coconut Chutney. The other person loved it, I hated it. The Naan Bread which came with it sucked.
Pork Shank with a roasted Potato. To me inedible. Other person enjoyed it.

Dessert was Fig Ice Cream Drizzled with Honey. I hated it, Inedible, Too sweet. The other person enjoyed it.

I think this type of food is not for everyone. I gave it an honest shot.Never again will I eat Indian Food I did not enjoy it from start to finish.  I didn't eat anything but for the one fantastic salad course.

First time we went: waitress was very nice but it was clear she didn't have much of an idea of what was going on, and I felt sorry for her. We could not get heir amazing bloody Mary's because the new owner forgot to order liquor so there was no booze. We ordered a pizza which didn't have much flavor but it was ok. As we went to pay she told us their credit card machine was down. Something you should probably tell people before they order. While there, another table had to send their food back twice, once because there was an ingredient on the food that he requested to be omitted for an allergy, and the other because she gave him the wrong dressing. They were polite about the send-backs. 

We went back the evening of a parade so we understood that the service would be slower. He waitress was very polite and attentive. The pizza on the other hand was just plain bad. Barely any sauce and not very warm. 

I hope next time I visit Nola they have their stuff together, because if this had been my experience as a first time customer id never come back ever again.",-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

PaqVsnbVfMs2ukFcRHn01A,1,"Wow! Stay Away! I love Pizza Hut, generally, but I just had the worst pizza EVER, with a topping of horrible customer service!

A couple of us were down for trying something new from this newly opened Pizza Hut. So we went with the hot dog bites pizza. What were we thinking? Because of the way it is created the dough is premade. So you don't get that normal greasy Pizza Hut pizza you normally expect. Instead you get something that tastes stale. I have had microwave pizza that tasted way better. In fact, I have had gas station pizza that tasted better.

The sauce also tasted strange. It had this abnormal tanginess that was just not right.

We each had one slice and tossed the rest aside. Yuck! 

When I called the store I spoke with a manager. I explained the dissatisfaction with the pizza and told her that paying $15 (we got extra toppings) for two half eaten slices was not good for business. After a long silence on the phone (I don't think she knew what to say or do) she blamed the premade dough and apologized. There was no offer to refund me if I brought the rest of the uneaten pizza back or any conversation on trying to keep us as customers. I believe she was not properly trained to handle customer complaints. I kind of felt bad for the poor girl. 

Needless to say, I do not plan on going back to this place. 

Oh, and let me tell you about when I went to pick up the pizza. The cashier was eating and talking to me with her mouth full. She was very nice, however. Although, she kind of dialed back the niceness when I didn't write in a tip on the receipt (are you supposed to tip if you do carryout?). 

A man in the back in a blue button down shirt, who I thought was the manager, came from the back and looked at me and then moved to the front of the store. He didn't say ""Hi"" or anything. You would think that with a new store everyone, especially management, would be very friendly and welcoming. In contrast, I got takeout from a Chinese restaurant a few months ago that had recently opened it's doors, and the staff was extremely welcoming. The manager even came over to us and thanked us for coming and spoke with us for a few minutes. What a difference.

Oh, Pizza Hut, you're breaking my heart. I think we need to call it off. There are other restaurants that want my business and they are willing to prove it through their customer service and quality of food. Maybe one day I'll call you again, but right now I need my space. Farewell.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0
I6K39y6rDS69MRo5XJUWqw,5,"So I did something a little crazy....

I steered my vehicle to the Deg Thai truck, and upon approach, thought that maybe I should try something different from my norm tofu basil dish.

I stared at the menu, and the owners made suggestions based off my dietary restrictions...but decided I would just stick with the usual...because it IS so damn good!

I went into Friedman's to shop while my food cooked, and when I arrived back to retrieve, the owners wanted to confirm I was a vegetarian. I smiled as I certainly understand why they would think such...I've only ever ordered vegetarian dishes from their truck.
I explained how I loved vegetarian food, but still a carnivore. They suggested I try the Massaman Beef Curry next time.

Instead, I decided to get both! One for the moment, and one for later!

Jay packaged up the Massaman Beef Curry in preparation to be cooked the following day, and gave instructions on how to prepare properly for the best meal. (Love this dude.)

E4t6QDiePKOIMR21ua70jA,2,"Mack & Kate's is usually a high quality, modestly expensive restaurant ideally suited when you want a savory, well prepared meal.  With this in mind, we made reservations for Thanksgiving.  Everything we appreciated in their normal fare was absent in their Thanksgiving meals.  Their normal menu was absent and guests were offered a choice between turkey or ham.  The meal started with a very mediocre fruit salad on bib lettuce - not worth making a plate dirty.  The main course contained everything you might want in a turkey dinner but, unfortunately, the food was served cold (in fairness, at room temperature).  The kitchen obviously had removed ALL the side dishes from the oven far, far too early and placed them, at room temperature, on the counter to facilitate easy serving.  This included:  mashed potatoes, squash, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, stuffing, mac & cheese and (yes) the turkey.  The food I was served was so cold I sent my dish back to the kitchen to warm up.  I got back a new plate with food just as cold.  My wife was also disappointed that the turkey dinner had no gravy.  Since much of her turkey was overcooked, gravy would have helped save the dinner but, alas, no gravy.  Imagine green bean casserole cooled to the point that the flour had turned the dish into a floury mush - very disappointing.  All this came with a price tag of $30/plate without drinks.

I don't remember his name, I don't remember much about the cafe, what I ordered, the service, etc.  Last night I hit up the same place with a friend, and though I don't remember much about the first time I was there, I had some definite d√©j√† vu.  

For someone who drinks beer but doesn't really care what she's drinking as long as it tastes good, Race Street Cafe has a good selection.  I took my recommendation from my friend's roommate, but when they were out of the beer my friend wanted to order, the bartender was happy to suggest some similar brews and bring her some samples.

I wasn't that hungry (read: I wanted to fill my gut with beer rather than food), so I ordered the roasted duck spring rolls from the appetizer menu.  The plate came out with three good-sized, crispy, full rolls, a side of dipping sauce, and a side salad made of mixed greens, carrot, tomato and a peanutty dressing.  I loved, loved, loved it and cleared my plate of all but half of the last spring roll, which, due to the two very tall glasses of wheat beer, there was no room for.

Also at my table were the scallops special, which was served over an amazing risotto, and the spicy southwestern turkey burger, which I didn't try, but my friend loves it so much she orders it every time she goes there.

I really liked the atmosphere of Race Street Cafe.  I can see why a date would have taken me here... It's a little dark, relaxed, has a decent beer selection and great food.  If you want to prolong your date, you won't mind the fact that the service is slow; more time to make gaga eyes at each other and come up with awkward first date conversation.

He gave us incredible information and suggestions for the menu as we were all newbies! We had waters before he was even finished taking our drink orders (great assistants!) He suggested their house made Toasted Raviolis, which we ordered, and devoured. They were amazing! Our server also continuously checked on us, and kept our rambunctious 8 year old entertained! He showed her magic tricks, and provided her with a coloring book and crayons! We all had different meals, and everyone was happy with their meal! Our server even gave our little girl a slice of cheesecake for her birthday. It was an amazing experience. KUDOS to Mama's and their staff.

My husband and I had a much needed date night and had a groupon for Chez Leon.  So, we decided it would be the perfect excuse to relax and have a nice dinner in the midst of the stress and hustle and bustle of the holidays.  We got dressed up and went out expecting some great food.

The decor is elegant and upscale, but all the food was just ok.  I had the chicken and it was very salty.  Everything I tasted was really salty.  We also had a sort of caprese salad, and I know it's hard to have really ripe, juicy tomatoes in December, but these were definitely not good.

I was actually not feeling too well by the end of the meal, so I got the creme brulee to go.  Even though it didn't look pretty when I got home with it, it was good.

LRJj4mcXMlJVJi_LGeCfwA,3,"When we were planning our trip to New Orleans, we asked our friends on social media where they felt we should visit and eat. This was the most recommended restaurant so we knew we just had to try it. We made this our ""lunch"" spot for our 15th wedding anniversary. First of all, the neighborhood it was in was beautiful and we enjoyed looking at all of the houses in that area. Upon entering, we were given a bell necklace (would love to know the significance of this tradition) and taken to our seats. At one point, we were taken through their kitchen to get to our seats which was interesting. The hostess was kind but made strange small talk about how she was feeling separation anxiety from her cat at home.... hmmm. Okay... we were seated and shortly greeted by our waiter who had much better things to do than serve us. Clearly. He was not personable and rather unfriendly. I think his name was Sway...? I just felt like I was a nuisance even though I didn't ask or demand for things. The service outside of him was great. We watched their waitstaff change out water glasses that had too much condensation on them (I've never seen that before!) and my husband was given a different color napkin to make sure white lint didn't get on his black pants.... they didn't give me one despite my pants being black and I did get white link on them so I am not sure why only the men were given black napkins. 
The food was fine. It wasn't to die for amazing but I did ask our waiter if what I was ordering was spicy (I ordered a shrimp plate) and he quickly replied before I finished my sentence ""it's not spicy, it's not spicy"". Well for this non-spice girl, it was a bit spicy but I sucked it up and dealt with it. One rule of thumb for people who don't like spicy food and are asking if it is spicy is to think about whether that place has spices in it that if MORE were put in, would increase spice. THAT is spicy to us babies then. 
The most odd thing though was that they had a fashion show during our time. It was something I had never experienced before. I don't know if it was a bad thing or not but I just don't know what to think of it really...

The prices are comparable, if not a teeny pricier, to many of the other BYOBs in the area--a three course meal will likely be about $60/person. 

Ordering here takes awhile because everything on the menu always sounds delectable, and it generally tastes amazing, too. I've always had a really good experience with meats here--pork, duck, and steak dishes will knock your socks off. The shrimp enchiladas are also delicious, as is the guacamole. The only minor disappointment I've had was with the grilled octopus, which was rubbery and vinegar-y. As hard as I try, I've actually never made it to dessert because the portions are so big.

Our bed was certainly not what I expected for the price and the hotel lacked amenities due to construction.  Very loud and could not sleep in. As soon as the sun rose, all I could hear is the BEEP BEEP of backup warning sounds on construction vehicles. 

I was not informed about any of this and for an average cost of around $250/night with tax and fees, I felt I could have done much better elsewhere.  Love Marriott but this hotel needs major help.  

One positive encounter was with the bartender at the makeshift bar, she was friendly and knowledgeable.

It could be a fantastic neighborhood restaurant - it's cozy and they have a great outdoor area when the weather is nice - perfect to walk to!  We went last night (a Tuesday night)after getting the Hot Sauce deal that morning and I thought they would have ramped up the service because of that extra publicity - not the case.

There were only a few tables occupied when we arrived, but at least 3 of them hadn't been bussed yet.  Our server was really very pleasant and ultimately extremely helpful but even that couldn't overcome the shortcomings of the meal.  

We started with the chorizo stuffed dates, by far the BEST thing we ate - they were super tasty.  The mushroom soup had no seasoning, the veal meatball capellini was a bowl of mushy noodles with no seasoning in the tomato sauce, and the mushroom ravioli needed salt, too.  The grilled cheese was the second best thing we ordered - and I always LOVE the sweet potato fries.

OMeyCuNSPP45bBbE_d0XyQ,4,"I was skeptical about trying this restaurant since hot pot has never found success in Tucson. However, I heard praise about this establishment and decided to give it a shot!

Food 4/5: You have the choice of a dual broth or a single broth. I chose the dual broth option to sample Potwhale's variety. Typically in hot pot, you choose a spicy and nonspicy broth for balance. Besides broth, sauces are additionally crucial for hot pot. Potwhale provides a respectable sauce bar for meat dipping. Be aware though, they charge for sauces! The wide range of hot pot fixings is a la carte, selected from a menu with dry-erase markers. I got the beef and lamb combo, but I could barely tell the two proteins apart. The meats were decent quality and tasted delicious with the broth and sauce. I must confess: The idea of boiled non-marinated meat never appealed to me, but Potwhale's broth had so much flavor that it compensated for its cooking method.

Atmosphere/Vibe 4/5: The neighborhood and business complex did not provide any favors for Potwhale's curb appeal. However, the inside was simple and updated. This restaurant is perfect for small groups of people (2-6) to merrily cook and socialize.

Price 4/5: They do not offer all you can eat which creates two scenarios. For lighter eaters, the price is reasonable; for heavy eaters, the price of each item will add up.

Service 5/5: Our waitress was very friendly and offered her recommendations. The staff refilled our water glasses often. 

Tips: Put in your vegetables first to soften and soak up the broth; put in the noodles last to absorb the flavor of the boiled meats. Sesame paste and chives is an excellent sauce for first-time hot-potters.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The manager is not the only one with issues here.  We've had a few noteworthy experiences, but I'll spare you the details. Pretty much the woman I mentioned earlier is the only one with social skills. She's the reason I gave this Wendy's a 2 instead of a 1.",0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

kdJ9ea31HJaJYRo30gxsrA,3,"It's been a while since I've actually had a meal at Cheesecake Factory. I used to be in love with Cheesecake, up until the point that Cheesecake took their amazing (and still irreplaceable) Chicken Pesto Pasta off the menu. Sad, but true. 

But this past week, I thought I'd give it another whirl and see if I can find a different Cheesecake Factory entree to fall in love with. So I decided to try out their pasta with meat sauce -- simple and classic. 

Their rendition of it was simple and classic in appearance but not so much in taste. The dish had a very generous helping of meat.. and with the salt as well. It was too salty for me to enjoy and couldn't finish the dish -- and I got the lunch portion! 

On the plus side, Cheesecake has lunch specials, with their pasta lunch specials running from $6.95-$10.95. And there's always their cheesecakes. 

Based on my most recent experience at Cheesecake, I say: life is short -- skip the entree and go straight for the cheesecake!",0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

kAt2wl_j9xE9vjL1w9AF5A,1,"This place looks quite cute from the street, but the service, clientele, and food destroy any possibilities it had of being a nice place. I went to dinner here with my best friend and boy friend on my birthday. We brought a nice bottle of wine and sat outside to share some gourmet pizzas. However, the table of people sitting next to us was so loud that we could not even her one another or ourselves when we were talking. (They had a giant bottle of wine--one of the ones that has two or three bottles in one--and a bottle of vodka on their table, but no food, for three people. They were dressed for clubbing, and seemed to think that they were already at the club.) In the nicest way I could think of, I kindly asked the loud folks if they would be willing to keep it down just a little bit so that we could hear one another talk. I apologized for bothering them and explained that I hoped that they could still have fun and a nice evening, just that we were having a little trouble hearing one another. I considered asking the waiter to do this for me, but thought that it would go over better if I asked directly, instead of asking the waiter to be my messenger. This clearly had no positive impact on the situation. Instantly, the group of loud folks starting jeering at us, calling us names (including profanities), taking our photos with their phones, and carrying on, as loudly as possible, about how they were outside and should be able to be as loud as they wanted. Eventually, we said something to our waiter, and he seemed to make friends with them and apologize for us having such an unreasonable request. I then went inside and said something to the manager who was oh so apologetic, but did nothing for us. In fact, he comped their bill because they were so inconvenienced--they went inside and complained about the fact that we asked them nicely to quiet down just a little bit. So, we ended up paying for our meal, while they did not, even though our meal was ruined. To make matters worse, the pizzas were expensive and the ingredients were of very low quality. The waiter kept raving about their freshly-made buffalo mozzarella, which had absolutely no flavor. I can honestly make much better pizzas (for a heck of a lot less money) at home. The place is cute, but the service and clientele are awful, the prices are expensive, and the food is mediocre. Save your money and head right around the corner to Gusto, which has great food at great prices. It's a lot less cute in terms of ambience, but at least the people who work their are nice.",-1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We stopped here on a Saturday night on our way home from a Union game. Normally we would go to Barnaby's or Duffer's, but we figured the reviews on Yelp were decent, and they all said the food was good, so let's see if we could add a new spot to our usual haunts. 

The minute we walked in we should have known better. The bar area was full, with people at the oddly-shaped bar and the surrounding tables. But there was no one to greet us, and there was a not-so-clean smell. It also didn't feel right, but I couldn't place why. After about five minutes a very tired-looking waitress came over with a scowl on her face and asked us if we wanted to sit down. We said yes, and she said they were closing the dining room so we'd have to sit in the bar area. No problem. 

Our table was sticky and the booth seats were dirty. So were our menus. We ordered nachos and something called Philly cheese steak potato skins.

What a mistake. The ""nachos"" was a pile of chips, some cheese whiz poured over it, about a head of lettuce barely chopped up, and a few tomatoes. We ordered chicken nachos - but there was no chicken. We had to ask the waitress where it was. She apologized and came back with some poorly cooked chicken pieces on a plate. We had to assemble the mess ourselves.

The ""potato skins"" was a whole baked potato, cut in half, with some cheese steak meat on top. It was embarrassingly horrible.

Our waitress clearly didn't want to be there, and neither did the chef. It was just gross, and frankly, ruined our night. We will NEVER stop there again. Never. I'm embarrassed just to drive by it.",-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What a feast! For the two of us, we were completely stuffed! Jason, the director of operations and also the wine buyer visited our table several times as we wanted to try different wines with each of the foods and the wines didn't disappoint either.

4) they actually have options for vegans. They don't call it out but just make sure you tell them you don't do meat or dairy and they will take care of you
5) if you aren't vegan you are in for some of the most amazing Italian food in town.

rAl5BjQdwiYcWHytRaEoBw,4,"I will preface this review with this: I would like to give five stars but during my most recent visit our server was MIA during most of the meal. I would have appreciated if she were more attentive throughout the dinner; we had to get other servers to send her over multiple times, which is not something I would expect from this restaurant.

My first time attending this restaurant was last year during restaurant week and I will say it was phenomenal! The restaurant week menu is a great deal: an appetizer, an entree, a side, and dessert... all for $35! I was so pleased with my experience. Our server was great; very attentive despite the fact that we were ordering off of the restaurant week menu. Overall a great experience.

As for non-restaurant week dining: I will say the menu prices are extremely daunting, but very much worth the price. I got the Del Monico steak, which is the chef's recommendation. Absolutely the best steak that I have ever had. The steak was flavorful and not too chew, despite being a fattier cut of meat. For sides, we got the stuffed hashbrown and the mushrooms and onions. The mushrooms and onions were not particularly special, but the stuffed hashbrowns were definitely worth ordering (it's a large hashbrown stuffed with diced potates, sourcream, and herbs - kind of like a twice baked potato).

I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion and if you're lucky enough to get a reservation, as a restaurant week destination.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Had a delicious grilled cheese at The Pork Shack!! Three types of cheeses and caramelized onions on some slamming bread. Highly recommend making it a combo with a nice handful of tater tots and incredible tomato bisque. The girl working the stand was so nice and chill. 

Steph got a delicious breakfast sandwich at Politis of a sausage patty, egg, and cheese on a fancy looking cinnamon raisin English muffin (that salty/sweet)! Grateful she gave me a bite of it because boy was it good. Truth be told I opted for the grilled cheese because the sandwich looked over priced when I saw it but after trying it I now understand why. 

Also had really solid coffee at Sky Roast on the left right when you walk in. The hot cups were styrofoam, much to Steph's environmental chagrin- she wanted me to mention that. TIP: 5% off if you pay in cash.

sLJPSGwxse1EuRxK2FPtkA,3,"Really had hoped for more but left pretty disappointed.   

Looking through Yelp after a day exploring the Franklin Institute I suggested we come here. Other reviews showed good food and we had some whiskey lovers in our group. After finding phenomenal parking we walked into the Curtis, you'll swing a left to enter the restaurant. A friend went in first and got us a table near the front entrance and across from the bar. Curtis side there was a group of younger people going through a tasting. The otherside, street side of the bar is about the same size and the washrooms are located on that side.

Overall my experience was average, for starters I had the crab and corn chowder. Previous yelpers showed a chowder with a big scoop of lump crab. I was sadly disappointed when my chowder did not come out in such a presentation and with stale garlic toast. I was slightly more pleased by my barbecue salmon BLT, a well cooked salmon not overly sauced. 

I think one issue we had was multiple people waiting on our table and no coordination or communication between themselves or with us. Someone at my table ordered a black and tan the person waiting our table didnt seem to understand the request. Once brought over the float wasnt done properly (later said they didn't have the spoon), it was eventually sent back after the first sip. For the majority of our dining experience we had to deal with a boisterous bartender who was fiercely peacocking for the young group mentioned previously,  one of these patrons was definitely over served but no one working seemed concerned. This boisterous bartender spoke so loudly that he was speaking over the music and made any sort of table conversation difficult. Additionally our multiple servers seemed to be unaware of some of the  menu items and couldn't even properly explain our whiskey flights and couldn't even pronounce Glenlivet (!?!?!)

eTz6vN_j9ioN39IXEnhCEA,4,"What a wonderful spot for diets that include both plant based and not. It was the perfect compromise for both my friend and I on out final evening in NOLA. There were a significant amount of vegetarian, vegan, and glutenfree options alongside sustainable and locally harvested dishes. The Corn Chowder (vegan) soup we started off with was delicious and exactly what our appetites were craving due to the blustery winds and chilly weather. I could have ate several bowls of this comfy soup. While I appreciated the Pomegranate Beet Hummus (vegan), it wasn't my absolute favorite - but this could be due to my slightly manic obsession with chickpeas and this version lacked the flavor of my beloved. For $8, it is certainly worth exploring especially if you're adventurous with your palate. Next, my friend opted for the ""free range beef"" version but I went with the vegan ""Formosan Tofu with Grilled Bun"" and boy was I elated! This entree con consists of perfectly crispy local organic lemongrass tofu with savory grilled buns and sweet Asian pickles. ($16) It is also served with a salad that includes a sesame dressing. I devoured this dish. 

My only real qualms about Green Goddess is just the lack of space they have for dining. The majority of their seating is outside on their alleyway patio with only a few tables available inside. On a blustery night like Sunday, it certainly made us rush through our meal instead of lingering over more wine or desert.

jZbYpMDz2j7biJViZH4UjQ,3,"During better times (non-pandemic) this is one of my favorite lunch spots.  I showed this dive to a friend of mine on a Dec Saturday night and was alarmed by this restaurant/bar's (lack of) adaptation to good Covid practices.  While the waitresses and cooks were all masked and very earnest about these times, I was dismayed to see that every single booth was occupied and none of the bar stools were ""socially distanced"" with ""X"" to block seating.  The floor design of this old building makes for very tight confines, such that the packed booths and passageways were all cramped.  Moreover, there was a tall curly-haired bartender, who was loitering among the three cooks in the kitchen and he had his mask (a makeshift, white bandana at that) completely lowered beneath his chin.  He was nibbling on things, handling the panini press, and chatting and laughing with everyone for about 15 minutes before coming back out front to the bar... and then, finally, remasking with the largely ineffective bandana.  All this during the week that the city, the state, and the country were grappling with the highest infection surges and highest ICU capacities of the entire year. I hate having to say all of this but it needed pointing out.

As for the food, there is a new meatball sub in town. It was quite good - small, tender meatballs, decent marinara sauce and baked with mozzarella (the only way a meatball sub should be made so that the bread/cheese are almost crispy).  There are still a few meatball subs that are better (Fresco's and Johnny Gibson's both come to mind) but not bad at all.

We split a Wisconsin cheese soup bread bowl.  Delicious but challenging for one reason:  plastic spoons.  I imagine they're doing this to eliminate the need to hot-water wash (but weren't they doing that the past 10 years anyway... I hope??).  The disturbing thing about plastic spoons is the incredible amount of plastic waste it introduces to the environment and, almost worse, the difficulty of ""peeling"" the delicious innards of a bread bowl down to mingle with the cheese soup.  This would be a problem also whether one ordered the chile or the clam chowder... you HAVE to scrape the soft, inside bread so that chunks of it can be eaten with the soup (and without collapsing the bowl itself)!  Only a metal spoon can make that magic happen.

fNNKm3QuHRo0YplkRbqVDA,4,"First Pho in Jersey.

Being a Southern California Native, where the Pho is plentiful, I was surprised to see the Asian food selections in the area -Pho specifically.

This review only covers the take-out side of things, as we were visiting friends in the area and wanted to bring them some Pho.

I had placed an order for some Beef Stew Pho, regular Steak Pho, and some spring rolls.  Well, I guess some miscommunication had occurred somewhere along the line, as I received egg rolls instead.  No matter, they were good either way.

I was told that the order would take somewhere along the lines of 15-20 minutes, however everything was out in less than 10.  There was a small waiting area up near the register / pick up area, which was nice.

The to-go packaging worked well -the broth was contained in large plastic containers, while the noodles + beef were placed in a styrofoam bowl.  The broth was extra hot, and managed to stay that way the entire way home.  The sprout + mint leave + jalapeno trimmings were packed away in a separate styrofoam container as well, and were fresh enough when unpacked.

The quality of the food was probably diminished a little from the trip home, but not enough to dock any serious points.  The pho tasted good, but wasn't mind blowing.  Perhaps my seasoned Pho taste buds are harder to impress these days.

That being said, the Pho wasn't bad either!

4 stars for some excellent to-go prep, decent pho, and expedient order fulfilling.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ceu9yvOtXUH5b3hfs8l2sw,4,"I'm a 50-year-old male, a longtime widow who is, for the most part, a serious, dignified human being. 

But, I'm not gonna' lie. I can't even say ""Mimi Blue Meatballs"" without doing that teenage schoolboy snicker. 

You could consider this a sign that I'm just a dirty ole' man who still thinks such silly jokes are still funny or, alternately, you could assume that about the closest I get to naughty is an occasional joke that is so obvious that you wouldn't dare make it in the restaurant because you know they've probably heard it plenty of times already. 

Sigh. Let's face it. I'm probably hopeless. 

Fortunately, what's not hopeless is Mimi Blue Meatballs, a 3-location Indianapolis-based, locally owned restaurant group that was started in memory of Mildred ""Mimi"" Bluestein Kosene, a member of the Kosene family who passed away in 2011 at the age of 91. The restaurant is a tribute to the kinds of foods that she used to love to make her family, while the restaurant's decor is meant to represent the kinds of settings she most loved. 

I happened to visit this Mass Avenue location, the original, on the same day that the Fashion Mall's location was opened - I had to laugh considering I had been holding out for that spot to open, but I got tired of waiting. I guess I should have just asked.

This spot is, of course, along Mass Avenue and while wheelchair access can be an issue on Mass Avenue I can say good things about Mimi Blue.  Parking is metered until 8pm on weekdays, a slight deterrent for cheapskates like me, but Mass Avenue has so much you can do that it's easy to pay a couple bucks for parking and grab a meal and do some shopping at local spots including HomeSpun right across the street. 

The front door is older, wooden with a glass center, but fairly workable (slightly heavy). You enter to a hosting area, a bar on your right and dining area to your left that is sort of cordoned off by wood dividing 1/2 walls that adds to a feeling that you can have some conversation while in Mimi Blue. 

The atmosphere is intimate, there's a television toward the bar but I barely noticed it. My server, Robert, was top notch. Of course, I started just by being impressed that he could explain 4-balls and 3-balls without losing his composure - I mean, I'm laughing now. There's zero possibility I could ever be a server at Mimi Blue. 

The menu is pretty basic and, as you should probably guess, centered around meatballs - six different kinds with a handful of sauces that you can mix and match. They also have slider options, starters, a small salad menu, a handful of sandwiches, desserts, and they do serve chili. 

Sliders start at $3.50 - most prices for ""main course"" type items are in the $8-10 range. I can't really imagine eating for less than the $15-20 range if you include drinks. They also have some sides, though it's worth noting they are extra - the meatball dishes do come with baguette. They also serve water at the table, individually bottled (think Napolese), and they also have your usual other drinks including my always desired unsweetened iced tea (that is served in a really fancy schmantzy glass that made me smile). They have a Sunday brunch and offer catering.

I ordered two of their classic meatballs and two beef meatballs, all four with marinara sauce because I'm basically boring. The balls are 2"" (I'm snickering again) and they were absolutely rock stars. I loved them. The baguettes worked nicely with the meatballs - while it wasn't a gargantuan meal, it was satisfying and got me ready to head over to the Yelp IMAX event. 

Robert's service was stellar the entire time I was there. In what i thought was an excellent touch, he was going to bring me my check - I made a statement that I planned to linger for a few minutes (it was early in the dinner hour, not crowded). I expected he would just drop the check, but actually didn't do so until he knew I was ready to go. I really liked that touch - it made me feel welcome. 

The servers all dress nicely and the entire atmosphere has a sort of business casual feeling to it. The restaurant has multiple places where a wheelchair would easily work including table/booth combos and traditional tables. Robert wasn't intimidated by the wheelchair - he moved a chair at the table and you could just sense his comfort. 

Overall, this was a truly enjoyable experience. While it's not likely a place I'd dine regularly, going back to that whole cheapskate thing, when I'm in the mood to spoil myself it's a fairly priced, high quality meal and offered me great service. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was incredibly happy. I can't wait to try the Fashion Mall location next. They also have a Carmel location on Old Meridian Road. 

While I'm not quite ready to fork over the fifth star, I am really, really close and this is an easy 4-star experience. There's no doubt I'll be back.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Whoever owns this place is what is called in the foodservice business as a ""nickel & dimer""  then wonder why their restaurants go by the waysides like those seen on Food Network's ""Restaurant Impossible"". Meal was pretty good but when the check came is what was the joke. Ordered an Italian hoagie for $6.50.  WOW, 7 slices of meat!  Billed $7.25. Why, because the waitress came out & told me there was no provolone (domestic) so I said sub it with mozzarella.  She said it would be the shredded which was fine.  Here, I was charged for a ""substitution""  I needed a microscope to find the shards of cheese.  Hey they didn't have the cheese and I actually subbed a cheeses which costs less and they screw me for 75 cents.  Then in another absurd extra charge, I asked for ranch dressing instead of marinara sauce for my fried calimari and I was charged and additional $1. Asked why, she told me ranch costs than marinara sauce!  Really.  Perhaps she should of told me when I made a ""substitution"", as they referred to it,.  Like a robot, she kept saying, ""Oh I am so sorry"" several times. I was looking at her back to see if she needed winding up! Sorry bullshit, What she shld of done, if she has any experience in waiting tables is have the manager or owner come out and address it.

In other words very small inside but quite charming. We sat at the bar and decided to start with a couple of top shelf margaritas'.

We approached the host and we were immediately told that the only seats available were two tables of four that were immediately behind the host/hostess podium (or should I say drumming platform, more about this later).  When we pointed out to the host (the lead drummer) that we wanted a booth and that there were 8-10 booths (75% of the available booths), he informed us that the booths were being held for call-in reservations.  When asked about how to make reservations for future reference, we were informed that Grill 54's policy is to take reservations for parties of 8 or more people.  The young whippersnapper obviously can't tell a reasonable fib as these booths only accommodate 4-6 individuals and don't meet the stated policy for 8 or more people.

After we were finally seated in the front row, we were immediately treated to an acoustic mash-up of finger and pen drumming on the host/hostess podium, that was immediately behind us.  We politely informed our waitress that this was very distracting and this didn't fit the environment; the drum session stopped for a few moments I thought it was intermission and I would be served dinner, as one of the members of my party already received their veal parmesan, I was still waiting for sushi for the next 15+ minutes.  

During those 15 long minutes watching someone in my party eat, I decided to ponder this restaurants business model. I have come to the conclusion that this restaurant uses its popularity in to put a fa√ßade on the true demand of their seats in order to push their prospective clients to the bar to order a few drinks.

Conclusion- Call for a reservation for a party of 8, settle for a booth for 4-6 and have 5 no shows.

We showed up at 3:15pm on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't believe there was a 45 minute wait for two people. And supposedly the wait is usually two hours long so we were ""lucky"" (okay we can roll with it. Good thing there were a few shops on their property to waste some time so we walked over there. My bf bought two jars of preserves for his family (on recommendation from said friend) even though we hadn't actually tried anything yet. Im so sad now that we didn't get a few jars for ourselves! 

The wait seemed to be over pretty quickly and we sat down to our late lunch. We got our first plate of biscuits and they were AMAZING!! There was a sampler of preserves to try out: blackberry, peach and strawberry. My favorite was blackberry and his was strawberry. They were all so good that there really was no way to rank them higher than the other. 

I ordered the fried chicken livers with the sweet yams and corn. He ordered the pork chops, hash brown casserole and corn. Our meals came out piping hot and I actually had to wait a second to eat because it was so hot (something I really appreciate --hot food is the best!). We also got the banana pudding even though we were so full. Took the dessert home but took one bite first and it's some of the best banana pudding I've ever had. The vanilla wafer is obviously homemade and has such a nice crisp to it. The service was fantastic and we'll be bringing our family back here when they visit us for the first time in the city.

We decided to call in an order last night so that we could pick it up on her way back to school. I called at 6:26 PM and placed an order and the cashier sounded like she had been woken up from a nap, she had the enthusiasm of a sloth. Oh well, we were starving and looking forward to the food. She told me it would be 20 minutes and our food would be ready. 

We arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later and I checked in at the front. We were told that our food was not ready yet but we went ahead and paid and began waiting patiently. The woman working at the front as cashier and waitress had a young daughter who was happily running around and was very cute and happy. 

There were a few diners eating in and happily enjoying their food. 

Their delivery person showed up after making deliveries and they quickly brought him several orders. I think I saw him come and go with orders about 5 times. We were waiting and waiting. The diners were also served immediately. 

We were starving. After an entire hour of patient waiting I went to the front and nicely asked when it might be ready. They said soon. 

A man came in and was waiting at a table near me and he looked frustrated. I told him that we were starving and asked him if he had been here before for takeout and if it took a long time. He said it was his first time and that he had called over an hour prior as well. He said he will never go back again. 

At 7:45 Pm they asked me again what I wanted on my tacos. It is apparent that they had just begun preparing our food!!!! We were beyond frustrated. 

We got our food at 8 Pm. No apologies. 

So, This place prioritizes orders on #1: takeout orders, #2: Diners who are eating in, and #3 ::: they DO NOT CARE about people who do take out.

Bjf47UtrCVzL9WtgSVoolw,3,"First things first- this is not pizza.  Jule's is located in Bucks County, near Philadelphia.  This is the land of muffin tops, cheese steaks and dark beer.  Thin crust belongs in San Diego as an appetizer.  When I think of pizza I think of something that I can fold to slid into my wide mouth.  I want my pizza to be thick with either sauce or toppings falling off onto my plate.  Jule's is like a saltine cracker with toppings.

But now that I have gotten that off of my chest, the food is actually great.  It is perfect for lunch or when you just want something light.  The variety of choices and speed of receiving your food is great.  Tonight I had the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom selection (see how I avoid writing ""pizza"") and it was delicious.  The naturally raised meats taste fresh and refreshing from your typical pizza place.  The ""crust"" is crispy but tasty.

Another complaint about Jule's has more to do with Doylestown than with Jule's itself.  Everytime that time I dine there I get frustrated with fake East Coast Hippies.  Now I love granola and going green as much as a Prius owner, but I do so without the neon light that impedes on someones dining experience.

1. Croquettes come in servings of 6 pieces. Two of us got the 6 piece, and the other had 4.... maybe the other 2 pieces rolled off. However, they were courteous and apologetic and brought a new platter of 6 pieces, so the lucky duck had 10 total. I was not to crazy about these... they were a bit more dense and doughy than what I am used to for croquettes. However, the chipotle-like schmear they used was very good.

2. Grilled octopus... three of us had at least 6 generous chucks of octopus tentacles.  One got gipped with only two tentacles burnt to a crisp. This one we just ignored. Beside that, the octopus salad was amazing. 

I also really liked to mushroom flatbread so I'd say the mushroom flatbread would be my go to if I were vegetarian.

3. Short ribs... everyone who had the short rib had mostly meat except for one that was at least 75% fat. This one we had to say something... and again they were generous enough to replace the meal. The flavor was good though.

The beverages are amazing.  I highly recommend the Maple Manhattan and there was another one with Bourbon and maraschino liquor (I cannot recall the name).

I don't know what brand they buy or from where, I've tried tracking it down for years, hands down freshest in the city. As for the rest of the menu. After Katrina they only sold pho. It was great. Then shortly after a new owner took over. The menu expanded to add three rice dishes-bo luc lac, lemon grass chicken and some other alternating dish. The bo luc lac was awesome. So much meat and so well seasoned. Then the ownership changed again. This time the pho changed. The broth was different. Then the bo luc lac changed. They started using cheap meat (the freaking horror). Fast forward to present day and another change of ownership. I went last Sunday with my Hunny and brother. The menu was completely revamped. There is now pho, rice plates, and thai dishes to name a few. The decor was far more American than I remembered- think Kirklands inspirational worded art work. It was very clean, which is always great. Hunny ordered the pho tai, bro ordered pho ga and I got chicken pad thai. Hunny said pho tai used to be better, bro said pho ga was great. I truly enjoyed my pad thai except there wasn't enough noodles to meat. That ratio is super important! And some of my chicken was cold. The prices are still decent. It is still in the running when we think of pho but it's no longer the first choice because of the inconsistency.

I've heard multiple things about the fusion of Vietnamese and Cajun food. Unfortunately I haven't yet had the fusion in re: to a crawfish boil but I had to see for myself the quality of the Viet food for myself a Viet person. 

What caught my eye about the restaurant menus isn't the staples or the one that draw your attention to regional authentic dishes, like Bun Bo Hue or Bun Rieu, which you don't see on a ton of menus, as the ingredients are pricier and the demand and familiarity of these dishes to non-Viets is low. But Ba Mien has a Bun Oc on their menu, mind you its Bun Rieu Oc but I had only had it in one restaurant in my life growing up and even that restaurant is gone in Toronto. 

My wife has really grown to love the Bun Rieu so that what she got, and of course I get the Bun Rieu Oc. The broth is swimming with the sweet and delicious crab meat. The sea snails are also a good size and have the bite and almost crunch that is typical with large sea snail likes seafoods. 

I also acknowledge some of the criticisms of this restaurant. The broth does have a sweetness to it. I'm curious if its not a by product of the seafood there but it didn't impact how I enjoyed my bowl of noodles.

Perfect location for drinks and sunset watching. Unfortunately, the very loud and poorly executed live music that attacked at around 5 pm mostly ruined the experience. Whining folk music filled the patio making further conversation difficult. The very reluctant service and warm, dried out oysters did not help the experience either. Bottom line: Get some drinks and enjoy the view, but stay away from the food (the other stuff on the menu appears to be the usual american-mainstream-restaurant fare filling enormous plates with deep fried and creamy sauce drenched items).",-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The place is bigger then I anticipated. There is large seating area in the front and another seating area in the back. This is where we were seated. On a rainy Wednesday night Dim Sum Garden was doing a brisk business and was at least 75-80% full. The design inside is modern and cooler then I expected.

The menu has pictures of the Dim Sum. They do offer other non Dim Sum dishes too. The menu is pretty large and varied. We ordered 7 dishes for 3 people. This was a bit too much; we could have gotten by on 5 dishes easy. All good, we took some leftovers home. We had the soup dumplings in both crab meat and pork. These are a must order and were excellent. The broth was flavorful and the wrapper was not too thick or doughy. We had the chicken on the stick and that was also very good and very moist. All of the food we ordered came out fast and our servers were great.

cXHApvaSX3uq7hewXk6Iig,5,"4.5 stars, i'll round up. 

I tried the philly brunch spot a few years ago, it was decent back then. I really wanted to try their dinner menu. I selected this spot to catch up with a friend, it's BYOB so that helped with the catching up part. 

The entrance was through the hallway not the double doors in the front. Not only did i find it confusing (despite the sign), many other patrons kept going to that door. Perhaps invest in a plant or a rope to block the entrance. We were sat right next to the ""faux door"" so we saw many many people get tricked using that door. The restaurant itself is really airy, clean, with an open layout. There dining room is surrounded by tables with bar height tables in the center. It doesn't have that homey feel at their Philly location but that's not a bad thing. This place feels fresher and much more spacious. 

Our server was awesome tonight. Very attentive, friendly, and just awesome. The dinner menu had some unique'ish items. I think all their breakfast/brunch items were available but i didn't confirm. There were two specials that sounded good but we went for the menu items.

-mussels in white sauce
-fried chicken served with mashed potatoes and veggies
-short ribs with polenta and spinach

The mussels were really good!! It was served with a chunk of fresh bread (about 4 slices?) spread with butter and freshly minced garlic! It was insanely addicting on its own or dipped in the sauce. 

I had the short rib. The dish was good, the sauce was a tad salty but if you mix it with the polenta it mellowed it out. The short rib was super tender and the portion was really filling. My friend got the fried chicken which i tried. I really liked that dish. The flavor profile was delicious. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd probably order that dish if i return for dinner. Overall, i thought the food was really good and the price was fair. Coupled with the amazing service and BYOB, this place is a win. 

I knocked .5 star for: 

1. upon entering, i did notice a strong smell of food/grease/fried food. It wasn't a bad thing, but it was something I was expecting. Perhaps their vents weren't strong due to the rain?

2. A nearly empty dining are, i was shown to a fairly large table in front of the window with an L-shape bench and single chair. The bench (seating area) was fairly slim, making it a bit uncomfortable as the night went on.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Confession: Until this morning, their breakfast burrito, served amazing red sauce, was the only dish I had from Jack's. This was my fifth or sixth time there and just couldn't tear myself away from the burrito. 

Today however I was brave. Almost. I couldn't make my mind up between the burrito and Jack's Scramble. I told the waitress to make my decision for me but not to tell me what she had ordered for me. Turns out that I didn't get the scramble. Turns out that I didn't get the burrito. She took it upon herself to create a mutation: the scramble inside a shell with the amazing red sauce. I'm still smiling about that meal nine hours later.

And it is the gift that will give tomorrow. I think I could have eaten all the mutation and potatoes and salsa and sour cream this morning but I would have been in a food coma for the rest of the day. Instead, I brought half of the mutation home and will be having another amazing breakfast tomorrow.

Coffee was looked in every five to ten minutes. After we both switched to decaf, the decaf continued to come.

I have had excellent servers, who are charming and knowledgeable, but I have also had several experiences where I have had the worst service in my life.  I am taking one star off for these multiple experiences.

I brought in a good friend from Miami, who is also in service, and we were ready to drink and eat like beasts.  The service was so terrible that my friend actually spoke with the server (after she literally ignored us with empty drink glasses for almost 1 hour, in an empty place) and let her know how terrible our experience had been.

Most notable is our experience a few weeks ago. I brought my 72-year-old father in and we ordered sandwiches. No less than 30 seconds after the waitress walked away, my father changed his mind and got up to catch her. I was shocked when she told him ""The kitchen has already started it, sorry."" Then she said that he could add something but would still have to pay for the first order.

Now, I'm not an idiot, or a rude, entitled patron, and I wouldn't demand a change to an order after a reasonable amount of time has passed UNLESS I was prepared to pay for two dishes. However, it is simply not possible that the chef even had our ticket by the time my dad asked to change his sandwich order. This was lazy, rude service and not appreciated.

we ordered the eggplant parm truffle parmesan fries and crisomething pasta the eggplant parm was from the app section so it was a tiny piece but yummy nonetheless the fries were super tastyyyyy and come with some dip i think garlic aioli and the pasta was a basic one  spaghetti marinara and cheese we got a complimentary bread basket with olive oil  we also shared a glass of rose  they had just one rose option by glass it was a little too dry for my liking

finally we got the gelato flight  5 flavors of gelato on a spoon
1 pistachio  yummy

its been a few years since i tried dinner at bobs usually opting for their generous breakfasts but it lived up to his reputation as a dinner comfort food establishment on my visit  nothing fancy just homestyle cooked foods without elaborate gourmet sauces etc at a very reasonable price in a nice clean restaurant with good service you could eat here often and be happy 

i tried the grilled chicken breasts  two of them again nothing fancy just plain chicken served with a wide selection of sides i chose a baked potato with al the fixings and broccoli around 10 the fresh dinner rolls right out of the oven were unbelievably good ask for more

a choice of other homebaked breads are served while you wait for your meal  banana bread lemon bread and a few others depending on the season all are excellent take a loaf home for an additional charge

its a busy restaurant but relatively quiet with room dividers and carpeting service is attentive ive noticed at many bob evans restaurants from servers who tend to stay on the job with longtime employment

the staff is very friendly and will explain how to eat certain dishes that you are unfamiliar with the combination of food quantity and quality is excellent everything is freshly prepared and homemade right down to their hot sauce tip ask for the special hot sauce my husband loves it it has a tangy smoky heat that gives your food a special kick

most things can be made to order for example we dont eat pork and there are a lot of pork dishes but most of them can be substituted one of our favorite appetizers is the natang it comes with crispy slices of french bread that you spread the natang over we substituted the pork for chicken and it was delicious the shrimp rolls are also excellent with some places it will be dripping in oil but theirs came out very crispy and light tasting their summer rolls are also light and refreshing most places make it with pork and serve it with a creamy peanut butter sauce but angkors is made with shrimp and is served with a light sweet and sour sauce 

as far as entrees go one of my favorites is the banh cao it is like a meat and veggie stuffed crepe that you eat with fish sauce and herbs note it is huge and can be messy if you arent familiar with how to eat it but this is where the wait staff comes in they will pleasantly explain how to break a piece of the crepe and roll it in lettuce with herbs followed by dipping it into the fish sauce and shoving it into your mouth it is really a hands on experience but the flavors are excellent again this is made with pork but i substituted the pork for chicken be prepared to ask for a box because you will not be able to finish it it is that big

one of my sons fave dish is the loc lac he orders it nearly every time we go the tender juicy cuts of meat are served alongside homemade handcut fries another dish that is great is the spicy stirfry basil chicken so delicious every bite you taste the fresh basil and the spice level is just perfect not too spicy and not too tame  

their noodle dishes like the phnom penh style is also fantastic and filling my other sons new fave dish is the mee pahut it has homemade chicken patty and the broth is light and flavorful its great comfort food for those cold days and nights

tonight we for some reason decided to give it another chance its reasonably priced and there  off we went hoping for the best but prepared for crap 

we were very pleasantly surprised  the service was very attentive and attitude free i was somewhat worried after reading some other reviews about that but no complaints from us 

the food was extremely tasty  we split the polenta bread which was wonderful hot and crispy crust topped with this wonderfully sweetsavory pesto sweet peppers sweet corn and of course polenta  we loved it and ate every scrap 

i got the lowfat cajun shrimp pizza and the so got a pepperoni and sausage  we both ordered small sizes  the pizzas arrived piping hot and smelling delicious  mine had at least 20 shrimp on it and my boyfriends toppings were similarly generous  crust was good to very good  and the prices were fairly reasonable  my only small complaint was that there didnt seem to be that much sauce on my pizza but that isnt a deal breaker

2nVQ9fMurDaqG85Mr33qbQ,5,"one of the first posts for this blog was for han dynasty so when i heard han was moving his oftacclaimed restaurant across the street i felt something along the lines of nostalgia before he moved i had to try the original location once more or perhaps i was just in the mood for damn good szechuan cuisine

hans doing well for himself having recently opened up his first outpost in nyc he remains a character which is clearly evident with his recent drama with the ppa no doubt he subsequently gained legions of additional fans im sure 

heres a shot of the new location almost directly across the street from the old space 

but lets move on to the food

dan dan noodles 795

meals must start with the dan dan noodles these are perfectly al dente noodles which hold on for dear life to the delicious chili sauce and crispy bits of pork the gf begged me to drop it to a 4 on the han heat scale this time around and it turned out to be perfect for her offering just a slight tingle to the tongue and whetting the appetite for more spice 

spicy crispy cucumber 695

a ubiquitous dish in asian cuisine these cucumbers were perfectly crisp with the sweet sour and salty sauce making this dish a mustorder as well the spice hits the back of your throat while the sesame acts as the countervailing element to tame your taste buds and imparting some savoriness to each bite 

pork belly in garlic sauce 995

this time around i decided to try the other pork belly dish at han dynasty this dish is served cold with the umami of the thinsliced pork belly and the garlic offering an innate savoriness to the dish the spicy sauce tantalizes your tongue with its heat

garlic sauce style chicken 1195
stir fried with ginger garlic bamboo wood ear mushrooms bell peppers

the thin sliced chicken was juicy and moist its completely covered in a relatively thick garlic sauce fresh ginger slices offered a bright element to the dish with the mushrooms offering a nice earthiness 

three cup chicken 1495

another mustorder is the three cup chicken juicy chunks of chicken are stir fried with whole roasted garlic cloves offering savory and salty flavors this is meant to be eaten with the spicy crispy cucumber and rice the ginger on the finish makes each bite

as always han dynasty hits the mark for the belly of this pig if they delivered it would be on the docket at least once a week but for now hans empire is clearly expanding so who knows maybe an outpost will pop up in the fairmount area as well",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

i really loved the stay but was unable to provide 5 stars for a few reasons 
checkin was extremely longtraveling with a lot of luggage we spent an hour and a half just standing in line waiting to check in there needs to be a faster way to checkin especially when we were able to check out on our tv with our remote 
 
we loved our room it was spacious but dirty we found blood stains on the comforter and bed linen and holes on the travel guide it was sticky with some sort green hardened slime that grossed both me and my sister out quite a bit the bathroom was clean and its spacious with a tub and shower head sink is spacious and extremely clean  perfect for ladies who love their cosmetic and having everything out 
 
the casino was huge and we discovered it connected to 2 other hotels and to their casinos and resteraunts which was amazing our first night we ate at the sushi resteraunt in circus circus it wasnt good at all they told us the wait would be over 45 minutes unless we did the buffet reluctantly we did since we were hungry there were two woman there since the waitresses there seated both guest for the sushi side and mexican food side at the same podium the one girl was very rude and even came over to me asking me to sit straighter in my chair for people she sat close to me i have an existing health issue where i cant have my leg tucked under me and it needs to be out somewhat straight and she slammed a chair in to my leg the buffet was not good at all i craved sashimi and all you could order for the buffet without being charged more was sushi rollsugh what for nearly 30 per person we could only order rolls the fish is not fresh at all being a sushi fanatic i was extremely disappointed they microwave a lot of the food so when we ordered rolls it would be cold and hot with piece of tempura or fish steaming hot and the rest cold it was hard for my taste buds to process for 2 people for the buffet and an order of sake the total was almost 80 way over priced i guess we paid for the experience 
 
the buffet inside circus circus was amazing we tried that on our second night and that night it was seafood night they had an assortment of seafood dishes calamari picatta crab legs seafood salads seafood enchiladas fried fish and even general buffet assortments such as potatoes french fries ham and other meats their dessert bar was wonderful an assortment of tiny little colorful desserts they also have pie and ice cream  
 
overall we made some friends enjoyed playing in the casino and photographing the wedding

anyway while this woman was waiting to speak with the manager she would reach down to pet her dog this wouldnt be so bad if she and her dog were outside but they were inside and the woman took a couple of brownies from the dessert area and ate them  not using utensils to obtain said brownies  while she was waiting for the manager before she paid for her meal

then after she stalked the manager bob until he finally changed the channel she literally stood in one spot and stared at him until he changed the station she paid for her meal and lead her dog around the restaurant while she gathered her food and do you think she washed her hands  or used the antibac liquid by the register  before touching the food or serving utensils hell no

DOB4Jh7TQHl4qYyw50138g,3,"finally authentic mexican

just finished a nice dinner at zocalo chefowner greg russell again demonstrates his culinary talent and unwavering dedication to mexican cuisine

walking in to zocalo you definitely feel like you are a world away from downtown philly the tables and chairs are hand carved and just very cool you immediately make the connection to chef gregs cooking that is the pride and passion that he and his wife and kids put into this restaurant hand carved chairs wonderful art and a warm welcoming staff and i have not even eaten yet looking at the menu you notice it is small and if you have read any of my other reviews that is a huge plus a great chef concentrates on a relatively small menu and making fresh dishes consistently zocalo has such a chefor two

we started dinner with with the chips salsa and guacamole the fundido and the mexicana and argentini mixed drinks you can certainly appreciate how fresh it was but even more so was the taste just the right amount of heat in the salsa and the guac was deliciously creamy with small chucks of fresh avocado the chips are made fresh as well our fundido was a blend of cheeses and we added pablanos all were a nice starter

for dinner we had the arrachera skirt steak see pic and the pollo santuario chicken and chorizo the steak was well seasoned and perfectly cooked the chicken was very tender and again the freshness of ingredients shines through each dish 

each dish we had on this visit offered very distinct flavors all well balanced

our service was and always is very attentive chef greg came out and spoke with us for a few minutes i think thats something many restaurant chefs should try to do more often

one area i think that can be improved is the presentation of the main course i understand the home cooked feel but every dish has this cup shaped scoop of rice and beans with pico and guac this could be thought out a little better 

some reviewers here complain about the prices im dumbfounded by that this fare is so fresh and that costs a little more it is by no means overpriced 23 for my skirt steak is not expensive not cheap either and it was a nice portion if you want cheap food go to any chinese buffet if you do keep the antacids handy

another highlight is the bar they mix some really cool drinks here i wish they were closer i think i would visit the bar for happy hour more often zocalo makes my list for creative drink masters

if you want to taste distinctive authentic mexican prepared with the freshest ingredients then i recommend a visit to zocalo

SBt1FnRwYxI4Xa5-qOFqSQ,1,"i gave management the opportunity of writing them a letter below so they could respond without my having to put it here  they didnt which gives the impression they only respond to complaints here when theyve been publicly criticized  it also gives the impression theyre not sincere in their responses to criticism in the reviews below although they make themselves sound convincing

there are two reports of foodpoisoning here on pages 2 and 3 the first dated 1317 the second 4917 both involved vomiting the latter involving a four year old vomiting 8 times  consequently the first reviewer restored his original review of 13 on 428 illustrating his doubts about the sincerity of the management regarding their responses to negative reviews  

i can only second that  frankly given these reviews as well as others here i dont know why anyone would want to eat here  maybe the place ought to be shut down given its insensitivity to issues  the letter i sent follows

looking over the reviews of your restaurant on yelp i noticed one dated 22617 about seating problems with the restaurant 25 full  you responded by apologizing to the customer saying you were going to look into the situation and retrain your door staff in regard to how they address seating  

i entered your establishment in midafternoon the place was virtually empty never mind 25 full  the hostess asked me what type of seating i wanted i said a booth and even pointed to those to the right where the windows were facing 309 virtually all of which were empty  she told me to follow her and tried to sit me to the left on top of your kitchen

i dont know if this kind of approach is a product of your retraining or something she takes it upon herself to do  if its the latter i dont know that blonde hair and a great pair of legs are going to make up for it  i consequently asked her for a booth by the windows and she gave me one but im not sure that makes up for anything  she may think shes a femme fatale but all she came across as was an asshole

im a public health doctor and have spent the better part of my life helping people to get the medical attention they need as well as their civilhuman rights addressed  if youre as literate and concerned as you seem in the reviews you might recall there was this woman named rosa parks who refused to go to the back of the bus  the events in charlottesville last month ought to remind you even more about people being treated with dignity and regard  

im not saying what happened is unique to your place of business by a long shot  that doesnt make it right  if a restaurant is crowded thats one thing but doing this type of thing when its empty gives out a message one that i wouldnt refrain from sharing with others  ive also read your subsequent yelp reviews on page 2  all from this year including the ones that talk about food poisoning and vomiting one that even involved a four year old child  since you put your contact information into the first  review i referenced i figured id communicate directly with you giving you a chance to respond  

if you are instructing your door staff to approach things in this manner id rethink what youre doing  i have close contacts with staff at senator caseys congressman boyles congressman evans and congressman bradys offices both here and in washington  ive just returned from a week long conference in washington where ive been meeting with them to address global and domestic health issues  i also have contacts with local county and state officials the last thing i need is discriminatory treatment and thatd be true if i were a truck driver  i dont think anyone whos a human being needs this

if you want to respond to this im willing to listen  i dont think anyone likes being given a message when they walk into a restaurant",-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
#NAME?,5,"The food & drink were excellent!  We started out at the bar, since they run a 5 for 6 before 7 bar menu (5 cocktails, 5 wines & 5 appetizers for $6 each before 7 pm).  I had a white cosmo while my husband had a mojito.  We put in for an order of calamari, which came out extremely quickly, and my husband said was fantastic.  I decided to partake of the free bar food, the homemade, unbelievably fresh potato chips.  Those things are god like - the perfect combo of potato, oil & salt.  Once we asked for our check, the bartender rang through to the hostess stand to let them know we were ready for dinner, and a hostess came to get us from the bar to our table.

We had one of the smaller, two person booths that were near the bar (not on the bar side, however).  Eric, our server, greeted us very quickly and got us some water while we reviewed the menu.  He did a good job running down the specials of the night (a few bone-in cuts, a black and blue sirloin & a halibut dish) and then left us to simmer in our thoughts.  My husband went the prix fixe route (soup/salad + main + dessert) for $37, while I did one of the Light Entrees, which is a smaller portion meat plus a smaller portion side.  We started out with wine - my husband went for a glass of Pinot Noir, while I did a the Red Flight of Interest (they offer almost a dozen wine flights - 3 - 2 oz portions, but only all red or all white).  The flight actually comes in a pretty ""fruity"" display, to me...it was a wire contraption that all the glasses hung in.  I guess it's probably safer than 3 wineglasses on the table.  I prefer doing flights when out, since I'd like to try a bit of everything, while my husband would rather do a full glass of something he's pretty sure he'd like.  Either way, you have your pick.

Our salads came out pretty quickly.  The prix fixe salad was a butter lettuce tropical salad, with a spicy citrus dressing, oranges, pineapple and cherry tomatoes.  My husband still can't decide if he liked it; the spicy wasn't crazy hot, but it definitely left you with that capsacin feeling.  I did a traditional wedge salad...and it's one of the best I've had in a long time.  The lettuce was perfect, the onions were fresh & the blue cheese dressing was the perfect combo of tangy & creamy.  I could make a meal out of their wedge, but I stopped early so I'd have room for everything else.  With salad came the bread, which was a whole grain baguette with flax that came with two butters, a traditional European butter as well as a mild cajun-esque one.

We did wait long after finishing our salad before our main courses came out.  My husband went with the fish dish on the prix fixe, a broiled salmon with a citrus topping and a small dish of black bean cassoulet.  The salmon was huge, well cooked & tasty.  The black bean dish was tiny and just okay, so my husband focused mainly on his salmon.  It came with a dish of mashed potatoes as well.  They weren't the best we've ever had, but not the worst either.  They were very potato-y, probably made with russets.  I went with the small filet, cooked to a medium-rare with the Fleming's potatoes.  The filet was perfectly cooked and well seasoned with salt and pepper (my husband was a bit overwhelmed by the salt, but I liked it).  The only complaint I had with it was that it was a bit fattier than I'm used to in a spot, but I couldn't finish the whole portion anyways (and it was still very good).  The Fleming's potatoes were out of this world.  A bit spicy and oh so creamy, it's another dish you could probably make a meal of.  My husband requested more bread during our main courses and we savored for a long time.  I'd think about doing the separate meat & potatoes instead of the smaller combo I got just to have a larger portion of potatoes.  We also got a serving of asparagus with butter, olive oil, salt & pepper to share.  Oh so tender & flavorful, I still only managed to eat two stalks.  I think we might have to go back with another couple next time so we can try more sides without feeling like we are throwing away food.

Dessert was delish.  The prix fixe comes with sauteed pineapple tart with ice cream & caramel, while I went for the good old standby of chocolate lava cake.  It was one of the best made ones I've had - perfectly cake-y on the outside and flowing in the middle, with ice cream on top.  Right at dessert delivery our waiter brought a little box of chocolates with a candle on it for my birthday.

The service was good, with a few flares.  The bartender took a bit longer than normal to greet us, they forgot my potatoes when they brought out the main courses & my lava cake came without the pistachios.  Not a big deal for me.

I think this place is really good.  I like the dark mood, the good service & the great food.  Dinner for two (two drinks, an appetizer, two glasses of wine, two salads, two main entrees, three sides & two desserts) was $135 before tax & tip.  Yum (and not horribly pricey)!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

One was a vegetarian who ordered a bean and rice burrito with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. He repeated his order a few times to make sure they had it right. While we were awaiting our food and relaxing, we were informed  that they were out of beans. About 1/2 of our order included beans, as that is a staple of Mexican cuisine. We stayed chill and told them to go ahead with the order. When the food came up, the burrito was nothing but rice. When we sent it back to get it remade, they served up the same burrito with sour cream and cheese. Still no avocado. They stood back there watching our table. Long story short - out of 4 people no one enjoyed the food. The carne asada was sweet and tasted a little like cinnamon. The meat itself was hard. We had gone in with a groupon, and right off the bat had been given menu items we weren't allowed to order, even though the items were on the entree list, and nothing had been stated in the groupon rules.

kLuTVUHXRo-UtHrEt_jSQQ,2,"The wife and I have been frequent customers since Kelp opened, and we considered it the humble gem of sushi in Tampa. It was reasonably priced, the food was excellent, and the menu was exceptional - especially since the mrs is a leaf eater. However, recent changes have left us wanting.

The new menu just doesn't add up. Prices have risen. Nearly all of the former vegetarian options have been removed. This evening when we stopped in, they had no tofu - a sushi joint that has no tofu, on a Friday night. The roll options have been limited and the rolls that are left are unimaginative on the whole. The miso doesn't taste as good as it used to either. After finding out about the tofu shortage we walked out, and we were both sad about it.

Twice now (the last being this very evening) we've been in and had the same server; a tall, thin, younger woman with blonde hair, lack of politeness, and poor disposition. Both times she wore mannerisms and had a tone that suggested we were an inconvenience for being there. We're approached with ""What do you want,"" verbatim, with an upward inflection. The last time we were in, we had to approach her for the bill and to get the bill processed after having to wait for her social group at the register to disperse. She is not a good server and really shouldn't be interacting with customers. Poor judgement call by management there.

Sasa is a nice Japanese/Chinese place near where I work. We'd ordered food in bulk for a corporate event, and the food was well received by the team. I decided to go a few months later as a personal diner with a partner. We found the actual place well decorated and kept. It was clean and felt like an ""original"" Asian-themed restaurant.
The menu was varied and the prices were quite reasonable. We went specifically for Chinese, though I noticed they have a Sushi bar that seats individuals. It wasn't too full, but we had gone rather late for a week-day night. The service was attentive, though for being mostly empty we had to wait a bit too much to order our bill.

z7-p_Vn4GNdfviKh7DUUQQ,5,"OK... I must first preface this by reminding everyone that Mann's Grill is a TRUE greasy spoon. They serve MASSIVE portions at the least expensive price possible. Because of this fact, much of the food is preprocessed, or pre-prepared. 
That being said, you will find NOWHERE that will give you the amount of food that this establishment provides for the cost. Wet side dishes (Mac n' cheese, cole slaw, green beans, etc) are served in small CEREAL BOWLS! many of the dry sides (French fries, ""home fries"", bacon, etc.) are served on separate plates! Every single meal will be served on at LEAST 2 dishes. For example.... Let's say you would like Lasagna with a side salad and apple sauce.... You will receive a plate with a brick-sized hunk of lasagna, and 2 separate bowls filled with the sides. One of the most amazing meals is the Mann's Breakfast... served all day. 2 eggs cooked to your liking; choice of bacon, ham, sausage or smoked sausage (probably on a separate plate); choice of hashbrowns or homefries (the homefries are more like french fries); choice of pancakes, french toast, or half-order of biscuits and gravy (DEFINITELY served on a 3rd plate because will fill it by itself!)... did I mention it's less than $7?! 

Every single meal on their menu (excluding the premium meals like steak and shrimp) is less than $7!!!

Burger and fries? Yep... it's a frozen 100% beef patty... just like 95% of fast food restaurants... the difference is that the patty will be cooked to perfection. The burger is big enough to make a Hardee's Thickburger look like a White Castle Slider! You will DEFINITELY need to use two hands to eat it! Make it a bacon cheeseburger and add a pound of fries, and enjoy greasy meaty heaven for less than the cost of a Big Mac Value Meal!!!

The atmosphere is extremely laid back and casual. A board hangs on the wall with available Entree items written on pieces of paper... as they run out of the entree (It's guaranteed the board will be almost bare by the end of the day) the paper is removed. None of the silverware or dishes will match, and your drinks are served in 32oz styrofoam cups with lids. The idea is to save on costs and labor to provide lower costs to the patrons. The place will always be packed, and the crowd and staff are always a quirky bunch. Nothing makes me smile like hearing the amazed exclamation from a patron in the next booth when the table is literally covered in food :-D

They are closed on Sundays (which makes me sad, but I respect them even more for it!), and they DO accept credit (in response to those who say they don't). There may be food that you don't care for, but the menu is so vast you should try something else next time. I live an hour away and still travel 1-2 times a month just to enjoy some good breakfast that won't empty your wallet, or to enjoy some delicious pork chops and burgers.

The main reason why I give it 3 stars is because the customer service is usually awful. Half the workers if not all are local college students who really could care less about your interaction within the store. Some of the workers don't even have a clue about the products they are selling. Most of the time you can see the guys behind the boba bar on their cell phones. It's pretty frustrating because you can go to a McDonald's and get ten times way better service. 

Of the 30-40 times I've been here there was only one girl who had amazing customer service. I wish I got her name so I could shout her out but every time I've been back she wasn't working.

I brought my mother here for her retirement dinner/margarita fix. She is the one who found it using Yelp. Nice work, Mom!

When she told me about it, I looked it up on the Yelp app on my phone. What is this I see? 100% off for some queso? $40 for a $50 Deal? OKAY!!  So I'm already $15 to the good on the adventure. I also used the app to get a reservation, just in case. I'm surprised at this point that my Yelp app won't go ahead and eat the food and write the review for me. Come on, Yelp!!! Help a brotha out!

Time for the Rita!!  We ordered up the first round. Aqua Fresca for me, Sopapilla Rita for mom and Girl. I win. Hers is really good, I LOVE the fact that they don't use sweet and sour because it's freakin disgusting. FRESH JUICES!!!  Love it!  Mine was GREAT!! I loved the little bit of mint they put in there and the pop from the fresh lime juice. I could have had a dozen of these, but I was driving. 

Next up; Chips, Queso, and Salsa. Great salsa!!  Loved the flavor of this salsa. Tasted homemade through and through. Really surprised me quite frankly. The queso, meh... Glad it was free. I won't come back and pay for that.  They could do a little work to that and kick it up to where it would be a good dish. Right now it feels like a dish they have on the menu because it's required for some reason. If it aint good, pull it off the menu!

New round of Ritas!  This time I got the Cucumber Rita, moms got the Blueberry Pomegranate Rita. Loved the Cucumber Rita!!!  I didn't care for hers very much though. Girl got the Sopapilla rita this round and they put salt on her's when she asked for no salt, and the first round was no salt...............    I said no salt, NO salt for the margarita, but it had salt on it, big grains of salt, floating in the glass.  I'll take my traveler's checks to a competing resort. I could write a letter to your board of tourism and I could have this place condemned. [/OFFICESPACEQUOTE]

I ordered the stuffed Sopapilla with egg on top. Moms got the sampler. Girl got the Mexico City street tacos. I lost this round. The tacos were good, the platter mom got had lost of good things, mainly the shrimp taco... YUMZ!!  Mine had too much dry chicken stuffed inside with nothing else to add flavor or moisture. Some potato would have been good in there, maybe a veggie?  The egg on top was over well. I fully expected a big runny yolk to flow over my Sopapilla, but it was not meant to be. I waited a bit for someone to come by and check on us so I could make them aware of this tragic error, but they never did so I began to eat it with a sad face.

Luckily, I had to many Cucumber ritas that I didn't care about my overcooked egg! Great drinks and friendly service won me over this night.

When checking out I had some confusion over the Yelp Deal. The server was deer in the headlights. She had no idea what to do with it. She calls a manager over. Manager looks at my phone for a second and says.. Oh Ok.. $10 off. uhh.,.. No.   I had to re-explain the Deal to them slowly and then they get it. I have a feeling that it will be screwed up in their books, but I don't care. 

And then they brought me Sopapillas....  Warm, soft, perfectly cooked Sopapillas....  They have a bottle of agave nectar on the table just got this. I was in heaven for a second!

Thankfully, after a quick nearby restaurant search to get us out of the rain we stumbled upon Newtown. From the street, it's not obvious there's a restaurant located in what looks like more of an apartment building so look out for the black and white signs on the front and sides. 
Upon entering, we received friendly greetings from all the staff and were seated promptly. Our waitress was pleasant and the flower arrangements on each table were pretty and unique to suit the modern-romantic yet urban decor.

After our dishes were delivered there was really nothing we could say except WOW over and over again. Everything was beautifully plated and tasted absolutely amazing. Not to mention, the appetizer portions were huge (equal to the size of an entree). I couldn't even believe they were half-priced as I would've been more than happy paying the full 10$ for each!

Inside: Traditional Chinese Hot Pot
Food: Hot Pot Buffet
Service: Pretty Chinese
Price: $25pp - AYCE

Little Sheep is a chain out of China that does Mongolian style hot pot. If you don't know what that is, it's basically Chinese fondue. You order your dishes raw and then cook them in communally shared pots of broth - with some variation on flavors available.

I love hot pot, and Little Sheep delivers. It is not 100% authentic but it is also not the westernized kind of Chinese food you may be used to so if you are unfamiliar with hot pot, come in with an open mind. If you expect general tso's chicken and crab rangoons you are likely to be disappointed.

The buffet consists of lots of food, mostly veggies and tofu that you can add to your pot but you will also have a chance to order specialty meats to be delivered (raw) to your table. Try everything. Especially the fish balls stuffed with roe. Absolutely delicious!

Now, you may have seen that I mentioned the service was ""pretty Chinese"" let me explain that in China you do not get the same kind of service as in America. The waitresses don't check in on you and ask how things are or if you need a drink refill. In china, when you want service, you literally just shout ""WAITRESS!!!"" and a server comes to your table. Little sheep is perhaps a hair more attentive than this but be prepared to flag someone down when you want something. 

There is a lot of great food in Philly, especially in this part of Philly and Little Sheep is a great experience. But $25 feels a little pricey to me. I've also been to this location on several occasions and found that when they switched to the buffet style, the selection and quality suffered a bit. That isn't to say the place isn't fantastic, it IS! But as someone who went there before the change, I preferred ordering everything from the table and the change causes me to rate a star lower.

If you've never had hot pot, Little Sheep is a great place to try it for the first time. And if you have, it's still a great place to get your fix. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

Mediterranean food is so delicious!  And vegetarian friendly.

Their hummus, falafel, grape leaves, baba ghannuj, pita bread, all on point.

I love that they offer so many options if you do not eat meat.  You'd be totally fine ordering a few appetizers (they are good portion sizes), or you can do any of 7 entrees.  7!!!  That's unheard of in most restaurants where you're lucky to get one vegetarian entr??e option.  On top of that there's also 2 sandwiches that are vegetarian.  The falafel sandwich is absolutely delicious.

If you order food to go, I've never had it not ready when I arrived.  When I've eaten in, the service has been great, and fast.  The atmosphere is wonderful in their new location.  The wait staff is friendly.  Service is quick.  And their glasses of wine are delicious if you want one with your meal.

DHxcK1SY808hH0JC2FYqLQ,5,"I think the key to enjoying this place is the same key to enjoy any place that is often very busy: Go when it isn't. 
I come to Edmonton twice a year for a week at a time for work. My tradition is to walk to the little restaurant at about 2 p.m., sit at the table in the back with all the light from the window and the books lined up on the sill and prepare to be there for an hour or so, and to spend about $25 for one breakfast. 
I know that service is slow-paced, and I'll get long descriptions of the specials. I get a nice pot of tea and investigate the beautiful array of condiments, (I've found everything form Louisiana hot sauce to rosehip jam to halvah on the table), and get a book on art or some fabulous biography from the window and listen to Edith Piaff or old Aretha Franklin jazz, and bask in the ambiance. The place is beautiful, full of old wood and art, doesn't feel kitchy or too antique-mall, just European. 
I get a bagel breakfast, which sounds rather pedestrian until its served. A bagel, fried potatoes, a slice of smoked tuna, a couple eggs and some fruit can be pretty marvelous when its prepared and plated with flair. The plate is art. The fruit is remarkable. You'll find a single sliver of a perfect fig, two fat blueberries, several black berries and raspberries that are perfect even though they are out of season, and perhaps some melon or a flower-cut kiwi, or a translucent slice of starfruit  or a dark-seeded slice of dragonfruit. 
The bagels are great, everything is really well prepared, but it's the details that elevate it to being worth the price. The smoked tuna is velvet-soft and scattered with capers, the potatoes are sprinkled with fresh herbs, the bagel is perfect. 
I take a while eating it. It's too pretty to wolf, and the music and the books and the general atmosphere are such that I'd hate to rush it. 
Botton line: If you're in a hurry or if paying $20 for a simple breakfast doesn't appeal, pass. But if you have time, and can catch the place when it's slow, and really like things done well and the sense of having stepped right out of snowy Edmonton and into some other country across the Atlantic, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0

LtWtdu_7nK78Ee_LI4zXEw,5,"We LOVED our dinner at Bluebeard. It is in a gorgeous, unassuming location on Virginia Ave, a little bit off of the beaten Indianapolis path - but don't let that fool you; it still fills up easily on any given night of the week.

The outdoor space is great: there are many tables for 2-4 diners, and a long, skinny table that can accommodate both larger parties or many smaller parties. My group of 7 was seated there and we were able to communicate with all sides of the table with ease.

Food menus change daily, which is just one of the many perks of this place. They have every single possible category of food you could want to order: snacks, charcuterie, cheese, salads, sides, and small, medium, and large plates. If I absolutely had to pick a favorite, I'd say the truffled egg toast - but if that sounds good, don't get your hopes up, because as I mentioned before, the menu changes and it might not be there!

Service was exceptional. Our waitress (Kerry? Carrie?) was so knowledgeable about the menu, as I would imagine they all are, and helped to make sure that our variety of dishes arrived at the appropriate times.

You're certainly paying for the quality you receive at Bluebeard. I would highly recommend trying it early on a weeknight if you're hoping for no wait - but also know that the wait will be worth it!",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

We started with the okra salad which I really liked and the oxtail dragon beard noodle soup. There are a few other noodle options (udon or glass noodles). Also liked the green beans but they were a bit salty. We LOVED the soft shell crabs-definitely get this! We also got the combo #2 hot pot ($20) which had 3 skewers each of beef, shrimp, and fish balls, with 4 or so half balls on each skewer and one type of skewer with vienna sausages. It all comes in a tall skinny little pot full of spicy broth that sits over a flame to stay warm. There are other pots to put your empty skewer sticks. This whole situation reminds me of late night street food in Korea and China. I didn't love the Vienna sausages but if you're a fan of all the balls you will love this! We also tried the crawfish which came with gloves to eat them but were still very messy and probably not worth the trouble.

But the real attraction here are the grilled skewers! These also remind me of late night little streetside shacks.

Bacon wrapped enoki
Cauliflower
Beef

Squid (a bit overdone) 
Pork Belly (also a bit chewy)

We love pubs (I'm genuinely part Irish), but the hubby insists he's disappointed with this one.  I tell him his visit was sullied by the nearly meal-long phone call with his dad.... he couldn't let it go to voicemail, his dad wasn't doing well.
My husband rates the breaded tenderloin sandwiches he's tried.  He rated this one middling though it still disappeared.  I ate more than my share of our crunchy onion rings and enjoyed a traditional fish and chips.  Reasonable prices for reasonable pub fare.
We swore we didn't have room for the Banana Cream Pie, but ordered it to split anyway and polished it off.  Excellent.
Server was nice and patient despite hubby being on phone.  Mixed ages in crowd, which I prefer.
So, though my husband would rate Muldoon's a 2, I counter with a 3 because Muldoon's is a pub, not a gastric pub or a sustainable pub.  Just a pub.

Again, not enough seasoning so it was like eating plain old crab legs that to be honest I could've done better making myself and I've never even cooked crabs.

After we walked in, we were informed that this location closes at eight instead of nine, even though the website says it's open until nine. So we had unknowingly walked in a few minutes before close. Some of the employees were irritated that we were there, and they didn't bother hiding it. We ordered soups and sandwiches, and we got our soup promptly. We had to walk over to the espresso area's register because they had already closed out the regular register. We stood at the espresso register for several minutes, awkwardly holding our trays, before someone bothered to come over and ring us up. Meanwhile, our soup was getting cold. We finally sat down and ate our soup, and my mom's sandwich was delivered to our table. I finished my soup, which was decent,  and waited some more. Still had not received my sandwich. I went up to the counter and started to politely ask if my sandwich was being made, which it clearly wasn't. An irritated employee told me, ""He's making it right now."" I waited at my table some more while a female employee cast dark glances in my direction. Finally, someone flounced over with the wrong sandwich, plopped it onto the table, and said flippantly and with no trace of sincerity, ""Sorry about the wait."" I was starving, so I ate the sandwich, but it was drowning in some sort of ranch sauce and did not even resemble a tomato mozzarella sandwich. I talked to a heavily-tattooed manager about my experience, and he apologized. I nicely asked for a refund on my sandwich, and he said the system would not allow him to do that, but that he would write down my name and the next time I came in, I could get a free meal. So he wrote down my name and number, and if I ever return, I'll have a free sandwich. His courteous manner is the reason I'm giving this restaurant two stars instead of one.

This being my first time here I didn't really know what to get so I perused the menu allowing a couple that walked in ahead of me to go first. They seemed to have been here more than once since they knew exactly what they wanted and the correct apparent lingo to get it. Meanwhile, I chose two hot sandwiches from their menu for myself and my husband and was ready to place my order at which point I was asked 'grilled or cold?', and responded 'grilled' and proceeded to place my order. At that point the worker seemed annoyed and sarcastically said 'so you DO want grilled?' Uh, yeah, like I said to begin with, but whatever. I proceed to the cashier who is helping those people I let go in front of me. He asks them if they had any coupons or points (?) to use and was quite helpful to them, maybe they were regulars, who knows? When it was my turn at the register a customer walked in at the same time and the cashier and a food prepper who obviously knew him started having a conversation with him. So as I'm checking out, the cashier punched the information into his cash register not once speaking to me or acknowledging me other than to take my money because he was still shooting the breeze about last night to the customer who walked in after me. I'm still waiting for my hot sandwiches so I'm standing at the counter while their conversation continues, then the cashier asks him if he's using any coupons or points. Moral of the story is I guess only regular customers get treated like they want them to come back, which is bass ackwards if you ask me.

Nope! We were seated immediately, which was nice. However, in between ordering our drinks/apps and our main entrees, they switched servers on us. Our new server was nice, even though it was a bit strange to be switched before ordering our main dish. Not even 10 minutes after we were seated, they began clearing and closing our section. We began to question if we had arrived too close to the closing of the restaurant. Nope, there were about 2 hours to go. Once we got our entree (my fianc?? and I split a full rack of ribs), they were not fully cooked, and felt like they had just been pulled out of the fridge. I then had to walk around the restaurant to find an employee, which was surprisingly difficult to do. They did tell the manager who did put in a new order of ribs, however at that point, my fianc?? and I were both turned off. We did receive new hot ribs, however he and I just ended up picking at them since we were disgusted by the original ones. They did not charge us for the secondary replacement ribs, however we were still charged in full for everything else.

you get salad with the dinner nothing special but it is decent . the bruschetta you get thrown in is fabulous piled high with a great tomato mixture. the basket of bread with 3 different kinds of bread one is better than the other amazing bread they have here .

The decor is really great, lots of greens, pinks, and tropical patterns. Only makes sense right for the Caribbean Room! We made a reservation and were seated promptly. We both got the Fish en Papillote as our entree, while I got the seafood gumbo and my husband got the curried sweet potato soup for appetizers. The seafood gumbo was good with nice pieces of crab and shrimp. My husband's was a little spicy, though the waiter did warn him that it would be spicy, so he was expecting that. The fish was really good! They used a local white fish, the name I'm blanking on, that comes with mushrooms (or no mushrooms for me), fingerling potatoes, and tomatoes wrapped in parchment paper. They bring out the parchment paper bag and cute it open for you and then pour in the sauce. The sauce was a butter and herb sauce. The fish was meaty, so it could handle the rich sauce well. I'm actually going to try something like this now for Xmas Eve!!!

For dessert we got the Condensed Milk Creme Brulee. It's not a traditionally creme brulee in that it is really flat and large. It came with a sour cherry sorbet. Our waiter told us that the sorbet on it's own is really sour, but it works well with the creme brulee and he was definitely right about that!

The service was excellent and the staff were friendly and fun!

Verdict: thumbs up! Definitely a Southern theme to the menu. They bring you boiled peanuts and cornbread - a nice touch, and the cornbread was great! Never had boiled peanuts before - enjoyed them. We shared the chopped salad and the blackened shrimp po boy. Both were outstanding. Chopped salad was unusual - had pistachios, charred corn, and little pieces of fried okra. Po boy was really tasty - shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned, with sliced tomato and a nice spicy remoulade sauce. We also had a side of ""sweet potato tots"" which were REALLY delicious and interesting. They came with an apple chutney seasoned with mustard seed.

Right texture, not too greasy, and they weren't greedy with their ingredients. Even the side dish of bean sprouts and mint leaves were a big portion that other places are more stingy about.

Really disappointed with this visit. Nothing like previous experiences. I asked the server if the restaurant served Barbara wine, by the bottle or glass I didn't care. She told me no and offered no other options or advice. I ordered a different glass and then the menu clearly states they have a Barbara by the bottle. I would rather be told I'm not sure than no and come to find out you have an option on the menu. My second complaint is directly to the management. A female manager came and checked on us. I ordered a pizza that was overwhelmingly tomatoes. I expressed it wasn't what I expected. I told her I liked tomatoes but this was overwhelming and I didn't really enjoy the pizza. Frankly, I don't think anyone would care for this overwhelming amount of tomatoes on their pizza. She smirked at me and walked away. Didn't seem to care that I didn't enjoy the meal and couldn't be bothered to correct it. Our server was also lackluster. She made us repeat things multiple times which I don't mind since it was noisy but she wasn't paying attention. I would speak directly to her and she would look away to a coworker or what was happening at the bar and then ask me to repeat myself.

They are consistently good, and the food is the same at both locations. Service is always EXCELLENT.

We come here so much and bring all of our guests that visit from out of town here. Our NY family and friend foodies love this place. We tried almost the entire menu but the highlights for us are:

-The corn beef hash is made from scratch. YUM

-Chicken biscuit

-Crab cake Benedict (Really good. Southern flavor and you can actually taste the crab)

I was overall very impressed and pleased with my takeout order.

I originally wanted just the caramel budino inspired dalgona coffee, but then looking at the rest of the menu really drew me in. I got the spring vegetable pasta (with a broccoli pesto) and the pork coppa steak (which was a last minute substitution, as they ran out of the other item I ordered that day) and arancini as the appetizer. This definitely comfortably fed my partner and I for the night. We were rolling around, completely stuffed!

The cheesy polenta underneath the pork coppa steak was to die for!! One of the best polentas I've tasted. The pork steak was also tender and delicious with every savory bite. The vegetable pasta was also excellent!

I think I've come by Barbuzzo before in the past for drinks and apps, and of course during the holidays when they have their famous salted caramel budinos for pickup, but I would definitely stop by when they open again after all this is over for the freshly made menu experience.

One time, my friends and I ordered three soup dumplings and General zso with rice all at the same time. TWO of our dumplings came out and we enjoyed it. However, the last dumpling we ordered never came. Like we waited over an hour, our main entrees came out, we even finished the main entrees but the dumplings literally never came so we asked the waiter to just cancel it cause we ain't spending money on food we didn't eat. After we told the waiter to cancel, THEN the dumplings came out and they were arguing with us saying that they won't cancel the order. After like 10 min of arguing, they finally cancelled it and didn't charge us for it.

ANOTHER time, my friends and I went and we ordered soup dumplings and my one friend ordered some curry jawn. That curry jawn didn't come until an HOUR later. We were all done our meals and my poor friend didn't even eat nothing cause his food ain't come out yet. An hour later the food comes out. We were obvs upset so we gave little tip. Then here's where it got worse. Them mofos literally stopped us and told us all to pay FULL TIP (on the check it tells you how much tip you should pay). Nah they never asked us, they told us to pay tip and was hella rude. We were telling them that tip is based off of customer satisfaction and that we were upset at how late the food came out. We ain't even give them attitude. We forreal argued for like 15-20min and these mofos said something in Chinese to us and told us to leave.

I told her I was hungry & didn't want to eat out again that day. She said, ""I'll take you somewhere you'll fill up for good."" She was right.

I ordered the Pulled Pork BBQ Platter with baked beans & cornbread. It was delicious. I slathered it in their classic bbq sauce. We also ordered the Cheddar Mac to split & it was so rich that we took most of it home because our meals were too filling to totally tackle both. 

My only criticism is the service. While our greeter was very friendly, she took our order & then forgot to bring my drink for a while. She then disappeared, someone else brought our entrees, and she didn't come check on us until we were almost ready for our checks. I never got a drink refill & when I tried to get her attention for a to-go drink she was too busy talking to a guy in the bar area to notice.

They do have two drive-up windows and though they had a steady stream of customers, the baristas are lightning quick--getting people on their merry caffeinated way with speed and efficiency.

One minor thing--due to the size of the place, it can be very loud.  Between the blender, the loud drive-up bell, and the baristas pounding the portafilter, it was sometimes difficult to carry on conversation.

My girlfriend and I were visiting Tampa and sampled a couple of places. This was by far the best, so good that after our first visit for lunch, we came back the following day for breakfast. We didn't regret it.

For lunch, we had the fried mac and cheese, the chicken and waffle, and eggs barbacoa. The mac and cheese was served with a delicious sauce, and it wasn't bland at all the way I'd become accustomed to fried mac and cheese being. The eggs barbacoa was also delicious and unusual. I can't say that the chicken and waffle were particularly special, but that's my own bias about that dish -- the syrup, which had some spicyness to it, added a lot to the dish. I also had the huge cappuccino, which had perfect foam -- no bubbles, thick, even with skim.

For breakfast, we had the migas, the fried oyster sandwich, and the infamous cold brew coffee. The cold brew coffee was delicious (and the regular hot coffee was also fantastic. We couldn't pick between the two.

GbrRLlL0rn5cUPU6VsxL6w,5,"The Lost Cajun was recommended to me by a friend. I owe her so much, because this was one of the best restaurant recommendations I've gotten in the 4 years I've lived in Nashville. Our waiter, Josh, took excellent care of us. We got samples of some of the best items they have on the menu , and I had a hard time deciding whether the crawfish etouffee or the lobster bisque was my favorite. We started out the meal with boudin balls which were very good. My partner ordered a seafood platter which came with shrimp, catfish, and oysters. He didn't care too much for the coleslaw but he really enjoyed the potato salad. I, on the other hand, don't eat either one but I tried them, and I honestly have to say I kind of enjoyed the taste of the coleslaw. I ordered the cat-toufee, which was the crawfish etouffee over rice served with catfish filets. It was really, really good. I tried one of the oysters from my partner's plate because I'd never had one before. I think it was an auspicious event, because I found a pearl! According to the manager and Josh, this is one of the biggest pearls they'd had a customer find. Between the food, the excellent service, and finding the pearl, it was worth the 30 mile drive to the Lost Cajun. One unfortunate wrinkle was their credit card system went down while they were processing our payment, so we had to wait a little while before we could leave. But it was not a hardship at all.

One downside is that often after work or at night it can get very crowded  and very loud; more than once we decided to go elsewhere because after a long day, it's not the most relaxing place to kick back. But the one bad experience: one night we were waiting in a (shorter) line for a table and the people who were next up had their table ready. However, instead of sitting down, they insisted on finishing their drinks at the bar first. Management should have stepped in and had them take their table or let someone else have it if they weren't ready but that didn't happen. So, our line watched this empty table go unseated for what seemed like far too long. It was almost a deal breaker.

My grits were less than warm (mortal sin) and the gravy for the biscuits didn't even come close to filling a monkey dish.  What happened?  They used to bring a whole cup of gravy.

I was craving Korean BBQ on that Friday night and all the grill tables were taken. So we had to wait, which I didn't mind but watching the food was taunting us.

KNZn2PmFr30zr-kfFY4qUQ,1,"This review is only covering my experience of ordering delivery from here. 

I was excited to find Wok Deli. Since moving to St Pete in Sept 2013, I've been trying to find a delivery Chinese place similar to Takee Outee in Oldsmar or Tokyo on Hillsborough Ave in Tampa. I found Wok Deli when googling ""Chinese delivery online order."" Despite the less-than-good reviews on here, I decided to give it a shot as I was stranded at home, with a baby, and no car.

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, an eggroll and an order of chicken lo mein. The lo mein was extremely salty. Unreal salty and almost inedible. The vegetables inside were bamboo shoots, onions and some pathetic little carrot shreds. No mushrooms, pea pods or brocolli like other places. The chicken itself tasted fine but the saltiness of the noodles was off-putting. The eggroll was OK, not bad. The sweet and sour chicken was either overcooked or the oil used to fry it was old. It was very bland and rock hard when I bit into it. I ate maybe 1/4 of my food and ended up tossing the rest in the trash.

The delivery driver who brought my food was odd. First, he didn't have a pen for me to sign the slip. No problem, I turned to shut the door to grab one. Before I could get the door shut, he was half through my front door. Weird, considering I didn't invite him in. I told him to please wait outside and he respected that but WTF. It makes me wonder if the ""no pen"" thing was a scam to try and get people to let him inside? I don't know but I just signed my slip and dismissed him. Very weird.

Overall, I would not order from here again. Food wasn't good in the slightest and the weird incident with the driver are enough to make me continue my hunt for a good delivery Chinese place in my zipcode.",-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We walked in, not really sure how this place worked. We were a little confused what end to go to at first but figured it out. 

One thing to know is they have one size of pizza. Which is fine because one was enough for both of us, but this definitely isn't the place to order for big parties unless you plan on spending alot ($11 for a thin crust, small/medium pizza, I think 12 inches). 

The place is set up like a sandwich shop. You get your dough, and you can either choose a pizza selection from their menu (there are 3), or you can choose your own ingredients. We opted to choose our own ingredients down the line. Tomato sauce, cheese, chicken, olives and mushrooms. My only complaint is I think the staff member could have added a little more of each ingredient, maybe if we had asked she would have. 

Pizza was yummy, crisp and not soggy or greasy.

At the end of the line you pay, and they stick your pizza in their oven and you go find your seat. The staff was super friendly and helpful. It took less than 10 minutes for our pizza to come out on a slow night.

We saw a lot of mentions of their ""socca"" dish for an appetizer. This was relatively underwhelming, but we also tried their escargot which was a total standout. For it being a first time try, we didn't go into it with any expectations, but it was cooked in a delicious garlic & herb butter sauce. It also came with toasted bread, which was perfect for dipping. Would highly recommend for anyone who might be hesitant to try to the dish - it was amazing. Our other appetizer was a pea & mint tartine - this was stellar. Really interesting combo, super refreshing dish. 

For dinner, we had the wild mushroom truffade. This came out in a piping hot cast iron dish which kept it at a perfect temperature from start to finish. It was such a great mix of flavors and very filling with the potatoes & cheese (we loved this for next day leftovers.) We also had the steak frites, which was a solid dish all around. The fries were like an upscale McDonald's fry, and they soaked up the bordelaise sauce. While the steak was cooked well at medium-rare, the only downfall was that it came out at just a warm temperature. We improvised and actually warmed up the steak in the truffade dish, and it really brought to light how tasty the steak was. 

Beyond the food, we were really pleased the service. The outside seating was cozy, but we took a glimpse inside the restaurant and it looked so cool!

I LOVED their downtown location and have been looking forward to trying their Greenwood location. I called and inquired about how late the kitchen served and was told until 2am. 

We arrived a little after 10. It was confusing. The downtown location had a host booth (even late at night, around 11pm when I'd go) but this one didn't have one set up. We stood by the door awkwardly. There was the immediate bar area which was SO LOUD. To the right was outdoor seating. 

I saw one server working (were they understaffed or people just taking breaks?). I sought her out and asked if we could sit anywhere (since there was no sign giving directions). She said yes. Went outside since it was quieter and took the two menus she left on the table by us (why didn't she just hand it to us??). Aaaand two jerk dudes were smoking cigars/cigarillos. That's disgusting. Even outside - no, jerks. They were at the front of the area so all the smoke went downwind - anyone else outside would smell it. As someone who finds the smell disgusting and has asthma, clearly we couldn't sit outside!

The bar area was full. We went to the left and there was the dining area! Except no one was there. Was the area closed? Again, no one there to help us. Which told me if we sat in the secluded area, no one would notice and we'd wait forever. 

So. I put down the menus where we found them and we left. And we were greeted right outside the doors with cigarette smoke thanks to the people smoking right outside. So trashy.

The other two got the chicken hash which was a beauty. Both said was really good. My husband had a mimosa which was $9 and crisp. Had a great fresh taste. Everything - drinks and food included was all ""light."" Definitely took some comfort food to a light refreshing level.

We waited 7 minutes for our order to be taken and the place was not busy. It took another 16 minutes to get our order brought to our table (4 burritos should not take that long to make). The music was loud, there were no carbonated drinks (we drank water) and they also ran out of rice. Not sure why the cashier would offer Mexican rice if they do not have any. 

I asked for a refund for my rice and the cashier charged me again for my meal! She got an attitude and blamed it on the manager not being there. Indeed, you can tell managerial presence was missing. She finally got a hold of the manager by phone who told her how to give a credit. It took another 10 minutes and at the end she told me that if I still had a problem to come see the manager another day because she did all she could do. She was rude and very disrespectful, she acted like all this was my fault. By the way, our meals were nothing to talk about, cold and not tasty.

LjBK2B5Sn0Jm42Aguv091g,5,"Thank the Maker I finally made it to Dmitri's! It easily lived up to all the lofty expectations I had developed after weeks of reading reviews and their menu. We opted for the Pine Street location. 

What we ate:

Hummus
Grilled Octopus
Mussels Saute
Grilled Scallops

I'm a sucker for good hummus. Especially when it's prepared well, like here at Dmitri's.

The octopus presented an opportunity for me: See, the octopus at Standard Tap is probably one of my favorite dishes around. I was eager to see how Dmitri's stacked up. I knew it would be a formidable challenger.

Indeed it was. Dmitri's rendition is chopped into small bits and served in a shallow plate with a light vinaigrette. It was soft and delish, full of flavor and simply amazing. (Since it's a different dish in its preparation and seasoning, I'll call it a draw.)

We were halfway through the octopus when the mussels saute arrived. We couldn't have imagined this dish would have been just as good or better than the octopus, but it was. A wonderfully ample portion of mussels cooked to a golden brown. They were rich and briny. 

Then the star of the evening arrived...the grilled scallops. 

Please excuse the text-speak but, OMG! 

Scallops...How many times have you had scallops, ya know? At the run-of-the-mill seafood house at the beach or near some marina. It is far too often a lackluster preparation. It is a food that can come across as eternally homogenous and easily taken for granted. 

Do not make that mistake at Dmitri's. I don't know any other way to put it but to say that a divine spark lies within their grilled scallops. One of the first things I noticed (aside from the generous portion - which was the case with every dish) was how soft they were. If you were to stick your fork in them with your eyes closed, you wouldn't even know they were there. It was like piercing the very air itself. My date started calling them ""Jesus' Pillows"". The degree to which they were grilled was spot on. It was ridiculous how good these things were. 

The simplicity of the dishes enhanced the experience. Each of these items came on their own, without a side. It's not necessary, just keep bringing me plates of grilled seafood and I'm more than happy. 

Nothing we ordered was more than $11 - $12. Very reasonably priced.

The fact that every successive dish surpassed the other was awesome. I wish more meals would go down like that. We started from a position of strength with the octopus and yet it got better, and better still.

I'll keep this short and sweet because if I get too wordy, I might start raging and throw my computer on the floor and start stomping on it.  

Basically we wanted a byob in the city that could hold 50 people...
1.  I read all of the shitty reviews for the rehearsal dinners and brought them up the owner so he could explain himself.  What he explained was a) he never reads his restaurant reviews and b) the reason why people got mad was because when they reserve the restaurant at 5:30pm for rehearsal dinner, they needed to be out by 8:30pm because that was the restaurant's second dinner seating.  He assured me that if I booked at 8:30pm, we could stay as long as we wanted which I was cool with.
2.  We put down the deposit in cash because we wanted to be nice, and booked the large room on the first floor with the large windows for our rehearsal dinner.
3.  My husband calls three days before our rehearsal dinner to let them know there will only be 40 people instead of 50 because there was a death in the family - to be nice so the owner wouldn't overstaff, order too much food etc...

.. AND WHAT DOES THE LOW DOWN SCUMBAG OWNER DO??

He puts my entire rehearsal dinner in the basement without even consulting us.  There were  3 long tables and not an extra inch of space to move around..  People were wedged against the wall with no way to get to the restroom unless they asked 8 people to get up...if there were a fire we would have all been dead.  It probably wouldn't have been a problem if my brother DID NOT HAVE A PROSTHETIC LEG.  It probably wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't have senior citizens who could not walk up and down the stairs easily.  It probably wouldn't have been a problem if it were a Bday party of 20 somethings but it wasn't.  It was my rehearsal dinner.

Came on new years day, when not much else was open, but we were desperate for food with an empty fridge. Unsurprisingly, the wait was 40 minutes, but when I called to check the wait I was able to put my name in and just check in when we got there to resume our place in line with a buzzer. 

I expected mayhem and grumpy service, but everyone we dealt with was really nice. our server was tired after a long day obviously and we were neglected a few times, we went most of the dinner without silverware (as did a few other tables), but honestly we didn't need it. The manager circled the dining room regularly to check in and help address issues like the silverware.

The food came quickly despite the packed dining room. The host walked us to our table with warm rolls in hand, so we got to snack right away. I've heard a lot about those rolls, and they're... fine? They're warm and fluffy and soft and sweet, but that is not exactly hard to find elsewhere. The cinnamon butter is sweet AND salty, so that does make it pretty addicting. As someone who came to eat here mostly to try these rolls, I wouldn't go out of my way to come eat these. The bloomin onion or cactus or whatever was crispy, went well with the sauce. Drinks were sweet but big and well-priced.

We didn't get steak because we'd just eaten steak recently at home. The meals are reasonably priced. Seeing their display of meat, it looks like i could get more marbling and more ""coveted"" cuts at whole foods + ingredients for sides for about the same price per person per meal. 

We got the burger and ribs, and both were pretty good. Nice smoke flavor, fake or not, were on the ribs - they're cooked to falling apart though and that's a little more cooked than I personally prefer. 

Anyway, I had a surprisingly decent experience here. For what it is - a casual chain steakhouse - it was very consistent even on a busy day, the service was decent, and the atmosphere was very vibrant and joyful. Everyone around us looked like they were having a good time. I think I'd probably come back for moderately priced steak some day again, even if I didn't think the bread was that lifechanging.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

My friend got the rest of her veal parm wrapped as well.  Today I went to heat up my leftovers only to find that the waitress switched our leftover bags so basically I paid $20 for one ravioli and 1/2 a meatball.

Let's begin with the positive:  love the location, right on Carrollton so I could watch the streetcars roll by.  Other than that not much else positive, except the complimentary chips and salsa, neither of which were a hit with me but it was nice to have them.  I ended up going with the veggie burrito, no beans as they were cooked with lard.  It had about a tablespoon of guacamole, fajita bell peppers and onions, shredded cheese and white rice.  Yes, plain white rice.  This to me was the biggest disappointment.  The veggies were nice but the burrito overall lacked flavor.  I dumped  the remaining salsas into it but it only helped a little bit.  If I go back again it would sadly be only for the location.

Overall, above average food for prices comparable or lower than many other neighboring restaurants.

qpbXedz_d3lsrc5z37rR2g,2,"Decided to compare the 2 best known cheesesteak places in Philly. Since Geno's and Pat's are just across from each other, I ordered a cheesesteak from each place with a bottled water and chomped away.

The bread:
-- Bread from Pat's was way too tough/. Not only did I have to bite into the bread, but I had to literally tear the bread in order to take any bites. The bread from Geno's was way easier to tolerate.

The steak:
-- The portion of meat from Geno's was much smaller than Pat's. Also, the meat from Pat's was much more seasoned. I'm not sure if Geno's seasons their meat with anything 'cause it basically tasted like unseasoned roast beef. 

The filling:
-- I got Whiz With (with cheese whiz and with onions) at both places. I liked Geno's onions better, but the whiz was better from Pat's since Geno's was very skimpy on the whiz. The whiz is easily visible on the Pat's cheesesteak, but Geno's put a VERY TINY amount at the bottom of their cheesesteak. I almost went back to ask if they had forgotten to put it on.

The price:
-- It's same at both places. $8.25 for cheesesteak.  ***CASH ONLY***

Service:
-- Service at both locations sucked big time. I guess it's part of the whole ""lure"" to be rude and even curse at the customers. But I am not into this whole dumb idea of  ""Hahhahaa. I just got cursed at at a tourist trap. I can't wait to post it on Facebook and Twitter!""  I still expect people to be nice, especially people who are servicing customers.

Personally, both places sucked. The food wasn't all that bad but it wasn't anything close to what I was expecting. I expected more flavor, more meat, more cheese, and most importantly, more taste.

My friend and I ordered the sushi for two which was $42, however it came with a lot. The other prices were a little high though I noticed.

What came with the sushi for two: 
Starters-edamame(good size portion) and either miso soup or house salad. We both got the soup and it was good, but I can't see how you could go wrong with soup.
Nigiri- We each got to pick from 4 kinds and each portion had 2 pieces. I got the salmon(super super fresh) and my friend got the shrimp.
Traditional roll- We each got to pick from 4 kinds and each portion had 8 pieces. I got the California roll and she got the eel roll. I tried both and they were super good and nice size rolls.
Specialty roll- You get to choose 1 to share from 4 choices. We got the Mac Daddy and it was really good too.

Overall the food was epic *****, the service was good****, and the ambience was okay***. Oh yeah I also ordered 2 Bloody Mary's and they were DELICIOUS, I swear maybe the best I've ever had.

Our meal for 2 $250. (we went to Luk??'s a couple nights after Shaya, half the price and much better FYI)

Service was the worst. Tabouli, hummus (king trumpet ), baba ganoush, were brought to our table, unfortunately, we were out of bread by the time. We asked a waitress for more and ended up having to ask her again because she admittedly forgot about us. Cool.

Lacroix was at the top of my list of places to try when an opportunity arose, and so I made reservations for their Restaurant Week menu.

We arrived and were seated at a table where we could overlook Rittenhouse Square. We each ordered different appetizers: I got the mixed green salad (tasty, nothing TOO special), my mom had the caesar salad (THAT was good, and the presentation was pretty cool - gotta love the parmesan curled crisp), and my dad had the fennel soup (another win - but then again, he does love fennel). For our main course, both my mom and I had the Seafood Tajine (like a stew with a variety of seafood including scallops, white fish, mussels, clams over quinoa and dried apricots) which was really fantastic, I love the spices they used in the broth, and my dad had the mushroom risotto, which he finished before my mom and I had a chance to ask for a taste (therefore, it must be good - he usually offers us a bite). Dessert was a trio of petite fours: chocolate banana creme brulee (meh - I'm much more a fan of the simple vanilla), chocolate ganache cake (soooooo chocolately, all you need is that small bite), and fig tart (so cute, so delicious - my fav of the bunch).

The cabbage and various vegetables were quite crunchy and refreshing. The BBQ pork was actually really flavourful as well, not overwhelming, but sweet and comforting. The pork was tender enough although it was slightly hard to pull apart and was by no means melt-in-your-mouth. The grains were a little greasy, though, but they should not be since it is just grains and rice.
The Country Lentil Soup was decent and had a strong tomato and vegetable taste. It was thick enough but not too much that it was no longer a soup. The lentils added texture and the ingredients were fresh and hearty.

The Cheesecake Brownie had a slight pungent cheese smell. It was more like a thin layer of cheese-flavoured dense cake on top of a fudge brownie. The heart shapes were cute, I though. The entire dessert was dense and chewy, the way I like my brownies to be.

Cos?? can have a really long wait time. The staff at this particular one seem very inefficient. There are so many of them yet food comes out so slow. It takes forever every time I am there.

kmaXPakvCFaWE3axlx2KwQ,5,"This was the best meal I had during my week in Philly. 

Let me start by saying that Philly doesn't seem particularly inviting to solo diners. This was one restaurant where they didn't make me feel like a leper for being alone. I sat outside in front for a sun-drenched lunch but they also have a covered outdoor patio which is really nice. The decor is nice and the staff is super friendly. Allison was my server and she was amazing. 

I had the roasted carrot and beet salad and the pork belly. 

The salad was phenomenal and the cumin vinaigrette served with it was refreshingly creative and nicely balanced with the other flavors in the salad. Everything was super fresh and the carrots had a nice crunch. 

But oh the braised pork belly....I almost can't find the words. Melt in your mouth tender and not too fatty with a nicely crisped base. The top was lightly covered with an amazing cider-hoisin glaze that was just enough to taste but not enough to overpower the flavor of the pork and not too sugary. Added to that were a few delicate greens and mandarins. I felt a little pang of guilt upon my first bite for eating something so incredibly yummy. Bottom line, if I was on death row I'd ask for the pork belly from Common Wealth before I got gassed....

But just when I thought I was ready for the chamber, I ordered the sweet tea creme brûlée....this is how dessert should leave you feeling...light, airy, and full of dopamine. :)

The service was well paced, polite, and attentive. The place is small so if it were busy, a little patience on the part of the patron would go a long way. A meal like this is best enjoyed slowly anyway. ;) Portion sizes were perfect for me for lunch. I finished everything and had to invoke my good home training and resist my urge to lick the plate.

This was my first time ever eating Indian food. I was super nervous because I'm usually kinda finicky. But, I tried things I never thought I would. Not being a huge fan of anything spicy, I was very hesitant. But everything I tried was exceptional. If you go here, don't be afraid to try anything. The service was beyond world class, it was a 5 star dining experience. 

The highlights.... So many (besides the waiter, Happy, sharing his stories of traveling around Europe which were awesome, and I also got to see the guy making naan in the tandoor.... So cool!). I wish I would have tried more, but for starters, I tasted the tangy eggplant. It was delicious, crunchy, so good. Also a favorite was the paneer tikka (cottage cheese cubes coated with spices). Being a huge fan of cottage cheese, I was very curious to try this. I liked the paneer tikka masala better, it was coated in a bisque/sweet sauce. Very good. The aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower spiced with cumin) was divine. The coconut rice was aromatic and as delicious as it smelled. 

One of my family members had the chicken Korma (highly recommend). 

Dessert... Their ice cream is so unique. I can't explain it, but you must try it.

The cheesesteak there is a bit saltier than the other places I've been too, but eminently just as tasty as stop 3 on this tour.  It returns back to the finely finely chopped steak-ems bits, but these steak-ems slices at least taste a bit higher quality.  I have a sneaking suspicion (besides that I'll have a coronary this week) that those that try Steve's will either have a preference for this place or Steve's.  They both did it well, but differently.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

-DSJWlFkg_gdyNgpMvxQSg,4,"i took my family to Twigs last night. Ok, so my wife dragged me to Twigs. So Sue me.

Speakin of So Sue Me, do you know of this sound on the Mac? Its actually called SoSumi. When Apple was 1st coming out with the Macintosh line of computers many years ago, they were going to have all these cool sounds. Before Apple, there was no such thing as sound in computers.

The music industry did not like it because Apple was infringing in their turf. Music. They told Apple not to put sounds into its computers

Well, Apple decided, in tru Apple style to do it anyway. They named one of these system sounds in commencement of the music industries opposition and called it ""So Sue Me"" (SoSume).

Ok, back to the review. I am more of a tee shirt, shorts, sandles and peanuts on the floor type of guy. Nod here to Texas Road House.

My wife is more of a foofoo upscale type of diner. Like Cheese Cake Factory, which this place reminds me of.

So, going to Twigs was not my 1st choice, or even my 111th choice. Even the name ""Twigs"" did not sounds good. It gave me visions of Rabbit Food and well. twigs. I want meat to eat, not very small tree branches.

But to keep the peace and keep harmony in a marriage, its a really good idea to keep your wife happy. 

Happy wife, happy life!

So off we went to Twigs. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. There were several things on the menu that raised my attention level. Unfortunately, many of them are just way to foofoo and expensive for me.

So I settled on the Hamburger. The one that got juices flowing was the Roasted Garlic Gorgonzola Burger. Garlic???? Color me there!

My daughter had the Oodles of Noodles. My wife had the BBQ Chicken Cobb. 

I was amazed when my burger came out to see full sized cloves of garlic. Not just a few wimpy pieces of Garlic, but FULL SIZED GARLIC CLOVES!

Count Dracula would never order this burger. In fact, he would probably die from the very sight of it.

I have to admit that I was scared. In all my years, and I have quite a few of them, I have never seen full sized cloves of Garlic used on anything, much less a hamburger.

I hesitated, but worked up the courage to take a bite. Wow! The Garlic Cloves were cooked in such a way that they were soft and chewy. I even took one out to try it on its own. It was like biting into butter, and had no bitter garlic taste at all. In fact, If I had not known it was garlic, I might have wondered what it was. 

It did taste like garlic, but it did not have a strong flavor at all.

The menu said that the burger was a half pound patty. I am not sure I buy that one. The hamburger though was good. I did not taste any Gorgonzola though.

It tasted charbroiled and smoky, I am a fan on this burger. I could taste what was an attempt to do something interesting with their fries, but it was just no where near enough to make them stand out.

My daughter was brought out a huge mountain of noodles. I was amused to see that they carried this hugeness of the noodles onto the actual check at the end of the meal. Every other item is in a normal small case. But the OODLES OF NOODLES was all in upper case.

The noodles were....well, what can I say about noodles. They were nothing special. Just noodles.

My wifes BBQ chicken salad was good. The BBQ sauce had a pretty good smoky flavor to it. I was not expecting that. The chicken was tender and juicy.

The Soviet-inspired decor was super rad, and although i was a tourist, i came to NOLA to see friends and unwind- Bourbon Street and it's crowds are not my cup of tea- so this place was a nice find.

My bf and i were on our way to Siberia to see a show when we strolled by this joint, and it looked so neat we HAD to go in, even if we only had time for one drink. We both enjoy the occasional glass of absinthe, and we were happy we had found a place to have some without going to Bourbon Street. Our waitress recommended one to us and we enjoyed the novelty of watching the absinthe fountain. Unfortunately, it was at this point that we realized we've been spoiled by getting absinthe from Europe, so we both found our drinks a bit lacking. Actually, they tasted really sweet, like Ouzo. (it definitely didn't need that sugar cube melted into it!)

If you have never tried absinthe then i would recommend you go to Pravda! to try it, but if you're used to the more bitter taste of European absinthe, check the bar out for it's rad interior and chill atmosphere but just get a cocktail!",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0

It's crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, very flavorful, and it really hits the spot when you have a craving for great Southern soul food. The fried catfish is also excellent, with a crunchy cornmeal crust and very fresh-tasting fish filets. The cream-style butterbeans and red beans & rice are also great. They have excellent sweet tea, too. The service is always friendly, though it is sometimes uneven, usually depending on how busy the place is.

I went for lunch on a weekday and walked in to no wait. I seared myself as the sushi bar and was quickly given a menu to look over. I went with the sushi lunch special of 3 rolls for 11.99, which came with miso soup, and added two piece of salmon nigiri to my order because I simply cannot get sushi and not get salmon nigiri. My food came out rather quickly, which I appreciated. The miso soup was piping hot and had good flavor. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, Alaska roll, and Philadelphia roll. Each of the rolls were fine but I've definitely had better. The rice was very loosely packed so it tended to fall off the roll when dipped into soy sauce. That being said, the taste was fine.

The service was a little shaky. Maybe my waiter was having an off day, but he really didn't want to be there. He hardly ever came over to check on me for refills and when he walked away from my table, he just stood in front of the tv right next to me and stared up at it for minutes at a time. I asked for him to tell me what was in a few rolls that didn't have ingredients listed on the menu and he flew through them. I might have chosen one, but I couldn't remember which rolls had which ingredients when he finished them, so I just chose something else. That being said, we all have off days.

Of all the sushi places we've been to in STL, Nobu's is the only place where we always see Japanese folks go to eat.  That says something -- specifically, ""...eat here...!""

Every time we go, we always get 2-3 rolls (Yellowtail, Rainbow, and St. Louis), along with nigiri of salmon, maguro, yellowtail, and the fish Nobu procures from Japan -- amber jack, horse mackerel, traveler, and Japanese red snapper.  Wash that down with plum wine for her and warm sake for me, and our sushi experience is set.

CYgRdtYQX6GaNePD7x6-iQ,5,"It is both a pleasure and a privilege to dine at Bacquet's.  And while talented French Chef Franck Bacquet, with vast food knowledge and delightfully expansive personality, doesn't seem a person who understates, I'd say he was conservative in comment line for French Onion soup on the menu which reads:  ""The best you have never had in your life.""   Because while  I am a person not given to absolutes, having had my first bowl of that splendid soup during my most recent (18th perhaps) meal at Bacquet's, I say you absolutely will never, ever find French onion soup more luscious if you set out on a mission to eat every other rendition every where!  Another of the many ""THIS is THE BEST"" dishes we've enjoyed at Bacquet's.  (Shrimp Etouffee, duck confit, croques monsieur, moules frites, seafood pasta, house salad, scallops with saffron sauce...)

THE EXPERIENCE:  Chef Bacquet is master of technique in the kitchen and starts with only the best and freshest ingredients.   His charming wife, Michele, is gracious with guests as she runs the front of house with a staff that provides friendly professional service.  There is no place quite like this in the Treasure Valley for European classics offering delicious options for everyone and warm hospitality that makes you feel as if you are guests in the owners' home. In fact, my husband says ""Let's go to Michele and Franck's"" when suggesting a meal here given the sense of ""welcome to our home"" extended through the ambiance of music mix that is perfect for French theme and set at a level to support conversation not drown it out, along with terra-red walls displaying a gallery worthy arrangement of French themed art and white tablecloths with colored napkins with everything almost literally sparkling clean that conveys unpretentious ""we've been waiting for you"" welcome.

Open 6 days a week (closed Mondays) and sometimes hosting special events and also active in community events, we don't know how the Bacquets do it all.  But we are grateful they do!

TIMES & MENUS FOR EVERY DINER:  There various ways to get to know Bacquet's depending on your budget and preferences.

Lunch service starts at 11:30 on Tuesday through Friday.  On those days, in addition to the printed lunch menu options, Franck also creates two main dishes of his choice and for a mere $13 one can choose either of those mains plus salad or dessert - an incredible value of excellent food as are all the other lunch options that range from roughly $10 - $15. 

Open straight through from lunch (which ends at 4:30 now, I think) with dinner menu service beginning at 4:30 (or 5:00?) Tuesday through Friday.  Dinner prices are roughly $15 for starters and $27 - $40 for entrees, the food is remarkable and portions are so generous we typically ask to take what we can't finish with us because it is so delicious. 

There is no lunch menu service on Saturday and Sunday but an all day dinner menu is used beginning at 11:30 with starter and entree options.  (Absent special event weekend menu  like Mother's Day Brunch as one example, when special menus are used with service starting in morning.)  

Lunch is served both in the restaurant and on the patio in nice weather months.  (Note: Sitting on Bacquet's lovely patio at an umbrella covered table on a warm Sunday at noon and lingering while sharing starter plates and a bottle of French sparkling wine beats the heck out of standing in line at a bacon n' eggs breakfast joint. :-) )

Dinner is served in both of those locations and also in the cozy annex room off the main dining room. 

Live music on patio or in the annex on some nights.

If you prefer to dine in quieter times with fewer crowds then lunch, ""linner"", and early dinner hours are a good choice.   This is an ""all people are welcome here"" eatery where we have enjoyed seeing people of all ages and walks of life.  If you are budget minded, lunch specials are ""can't be beat"" option.

WINE:  Corkage is $30 but it is highly unlikely you'd want to bring your own given the many options in house. There is no printed wine list but lots of by bottles of European and domestic wines  - in choices from under $30 to over $100  - displayed in racks and cooler case alongside the wine bar.  There are also by glass offerings in several varietals by a good French vintner, a favorite of the Chef's. Pours are generous for only about $7.50.  And applause for this, they now offer a French sparkling wine  and Champagne by glass starting at $12.  Top quality stemware is used for all.  Also a few beers on tap, soft beverages and coffee service.

ACCESSIBILITY:  Level on the patio and inside.  All standard height seating.  Some tables have needed space for diners using wheelchairs. I notice equal access (aka ADA) since I have had MS since college days.

ATTIRE: Casual. Or as Michele cleverly said one day, the only ""requirement"" is to wear clothes.

 PARKING:  Private lot. 

RESERVATIONS:  Not required recommended during dinner hours.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I ordered the oxtail plate and it was perfect! The plate comes with a hearty side of beans and rice and a salad. It wasn't spicy, but had a good ole kick to it. It took about 25 minutes to cook because everything is prepared made-to-order by the lovely and hospitable Chef Janice. Worth the wait!

FR9DouaINTCU4K_jinZ5rg,3,"A group of five of us came here for late lunch/early dinner around 4pm on Sunday. This Vietnamese restaurant is connected to the King of Prussia Mall, so if you're shopping and want to grab dinner you can access it from the inside of the mall. We came from the outside of the mall. There was ample parking spaces. For a large group, we were seated really quickly! The interior design was based on an American diner, which did not provide the most authentic vibe, but I liked how it was well lit and spacious. It was a casual setting that was great for large groups.

FIRST IMPRESSION: The menu had a wide selection of Vietnamese foods. I have been to many pho places previously, and I was impressed by the variety of noodle soups beyond the classic chicken and beef noodle soups. I was also impressed by the variety of flavors for bubble teas and smoothies.

SERVICE: Service was average. When I first indicated what I wanted, I started by saying ""Vietnamese Crab Noodle Soup"" but was immediately cut off by the waiter. I just had to say the corresponding number for that item on the menu, which was a little confusing. My friend ordered Vietnamese spring rolls for appetizers, which came after all our bowls of pho arrived. We were expecting the appetizers to come first, before the main course. Also, my friend ordered fried rice as an extra meal to-go, but it was never brought out. Either the waiter didn't hear her or he forgot. We were not charged for it, so we didn't bring it up. It was also disappointing that they didn't have certain smoothie flavors in stock. My other friend wanted to order the Taro Smoothie, but they ran out of it. He then wanted to order the Pineapple smoothie, but that was also gone. He settled for the Mango smoothie. 


FOOD: As an adventurous eater, I ordered Vietnamese Crab Noodle Soup with rice noodles. Portions of noodles and meat were generous. I had one bite of the crab meat, and the seafood flavors of the meat and the soup did not sit well with my stomach. The rice noodles were fine, though. I would not recommend the Vietnamese Crab Noodle Soup. I wish I had ordered the classic Pho soups that my friends got. 

For drinks, I ordered the lychee smoothie, and was excited that it came with boba. The smoothie tasted great! The boba was not too hard, and was chewy enough. The Mango smoothies was also delicious, very rich and flavorful. Would recommend the smoothies.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

RniKB-LcwJsAZQY6nBM5Xg,3,"I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times in the past year, and it is by far one of my favorite places to go for dinner. 

Do not bother to make a reservation unless it is a weekend. Even if you call ahead, you will either get seated at a dirty table while the staff cleans up in front if you after you've been seated... or you will have to stand around in the front to wait 20-30 minutes for a free table anyway.  

The whole grilling experience is definitely fun, the atmosphere is lively, and the meat is amazing. All the of the sauces they marinate it in definitely add some epic flavor. Order the Premium Sirloin, the Harami Skirt Steak and the shrimp with chili dumplings. 

However, the reason I have given Gyu-Kaku only 3/5 stars is due to the service and the drinks. The food is good, but is not outshined by the terrible service. 

NEVER, and I repeat... NEVER order a mixed drink here. You will only receive one of two things: plain juice, or the worst mixed drink you've ever tasted. Rubbing alcohol with a hint of cherry cough syrup basically. Only order beer, wine, and even the liquor is questionable. They definitely should be byob.

The wait staff is very slow. And indeed, this restaurant is understandably busy. Especially on the weekend. But it takes 45 minutes - 1 hour to bring out appetizers. Forever to even get a fork (they don't use them in the place settings) and your first glass of ice water will take at least half an hour. 

For such a busy and popular place, they should have a much smoother operation. The atmosphere in the walkways and with the waitstaff is as busy as a New York City Street.

It is nothing that will blow your socks off, but it is good bar food! Syberg's has some of the best wings in town, huge & tasty salads, and various other great entree choices. 

Their wings are fried, which gives them a great crunch, and then to make them even better...they are dipped in a delicious mustard/buffalo sauce. The are about $1/wing and are worth every penny!

It is an enormous amount of iceberg lettuce topped with grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, onions, Gorgonzola cheese, Syberg's oil-soaked (but oh so delicious!) croutons, chopped tomatoes, and chopped hard-boiled eggs.

Vfx7hb1y37x14BiaSV-oRA,1,"**UPDATED** As expected, I've received zero communication from the business within 24 hours of my original post. As promised, that means a charge back for the cost of my meal, 1 out of 5 permanent Yelp Stars, and a new category: 3 out of 3 Shania Twain's for service recovery that ""Don't Impress Me Much."" I'll never be back, and I'd suggest other customers do the same by not bothering spending their money here!

Deli Towne USA is located in the Horrorville heartland of America's restaurant experiences. I came here with much anticipation of trying the cuban sandwich, only to have the anticipated experience completely ruined by the service, the food, and the environment.

Since my rating is so low, I'd like to address the elephant in the room. I ordered at one of their automated kiosks, much like you do at a McDonald's if you insist on it. I hate this concept, especially for a customizable sandwich that costs well over $10 for a reasonable portion. Maybe some people like automation, but I hate it.

That was actually the best part of the entire experience. It all went south from there.

I took a seat in the restaurant, watching the five or more kitchen staff prepare orders at around 3pm. There was no one else seated in the place.

I overheard the staff joking about how ""you have to tip."" My ears are very good, as I've played classical violin for over 20 years. The plexiglass partition didn't hide much of the boisterous conversation coming from two of the staff. I've also worked in the service industry up until COVID, and no, actually, NOBODY is REQUIRED to tip. It's a gratuity, and you're working in a quick service concept. If you insist on making sandwiches until you're approaching 40 years of age, by all means, go for it. But do so without an expectation of my appreciation.

Which brings me to the worst part of everything: I go to pick up my sandwich with the name I had entered at the kiosk, ""Chris B."" The lady called it out twice as I stood up, and then went back into the kitchen for some reason. When she came back out, she called out ""Chris B?"" again, and then chuckled loudly with the staff, ""Crispy?"" as several of the older staff laughed.

Thanks for providing me the sort of service I'd anticipate from middle school students instead of the marginal service I expected from the kiosk that set the stage for it in the first place.

How sad a place this is, with such people in it, as old as they appear, without so much as the common courtesy one might expect from you local Wal-Mart.

As for the food, the cheese in my tiny ass sandwich wasn't even melted, and at no point did any of the staff ask anybody how their food was. I'd much rather give my sandwich business to The Urban Deli, which charges the same prices for the same size sandwiches, yet treats its customers like the valued guests they are.

As Reno's Yelp Elite, I'll agree to delete this unfortunate review if I receive a sincere, personal apology from the owner within 24 hours. Otherwise, I will charge back the transaction I paid for. You deserve NONE of my money for your employees' behavior this afternoon.",-1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My husband took me here for a surprise breakfast, something I'm always a little wary about, because he doesn't use Yelp to check the place out first. We walked in and were immediately greeted like old friends. The owner who was behind the coffee bar saw me looking over all the different coffee presses that looked like they were different styles from around the world and came over to explain them and also to explain what single origin coffee he had at the time. As a lifelong coffee addict, I was instantly intrigued and was so excited to learn about new coffee preparation styles. We decided on a single origin Sumatran coffee prepared with an aeropress. He came by and prepared it table side which was so near to watch. He prepared it with precision and obvious knowledge about what was important for the flavor. After he was done, we drank it without sugar or milk, something I have never done before. We could taste all the notes that are supposed to be there in a single origin without any distractions. 

Now on to the food! We came for breakfast, but the lunch menu looked very enticing. It was a hard decision. We like to eat a few small plates and this place delivered. We ordered a egg scramble on a croissant, a BCT on boillon bread with bacon, cheese, and tomato, Belgian waffles, and a side of cheese grits. If the owner was taken back by how much food we were eating, he didn't show it.  

Everything tasted fresh and obviously prepared to order. It was all priced very affordable. It's unusual to go to a place that has such great food and service and not have any pretentiousness, so refreshing.

MAbKEhMniOnVyxb2Of_i4w,1,"Three strikes aaaand you're out. 

We were seated at the far end of the bar. As in far end where there was no chef, and no fish in the cooler. When the chef saw this, he ""had words"" with the server/hostess ( so at least SOMEBODY sees a problem here...) 

Again, he was the only chef working, and it took fifteen minutes to get the first two rolls. I was exasperated at the deja-vu-y-ness of the entire sitch, and asked(told) the server to seat us at a table. She agreed that it might be better since we could fill out the order paper and keep the order organized. Then she wandered off. A few minutes later, I gave her the ""WTF?"" look, as we were still waiting patiently at the bar to be reseated. She ambled back over casually and told us ""anywhere is -fine"". Oh. Today must be ""Guess-what-the-server-is-thinking day"". 

So we went ahead and moved all our stuff over to an actual table, I filled out the order form, and submitted it. And by ""submitted it"", I of course mean, ""I tracked down the server and thrust the paper at her"". The order consisted of 6 long rolls, 3 hand rolls, and four different orders of nigiri. 

About ten minutes later, we got (what I thought to be) the first part of the order. I dig when a place will break a table order down and send it out in parts. It just seems like a more reasonable way to send it out, rather than making the table wait 25-30 minutes and then bringing the whole thing at once. 

The plate had 3 (out of 6) long rolls, 1 (out of 3) hand rolls, and 1 (out of 4) of the nigiri orders. 

But apparently that was ""all we can eat"" because that was it, nothing else ever came out. After we were finishing up with the first plate, I pinged the server to find out how long we had on the rest. ""Rest of what?"" is NOT an acceptable answer in this scenario. Again, I gave the ""WTF?"" look, and she sauntered over to the (new) chef who had taken over for the initial one. 

I understand communication breakdowns can happen from time to time, but DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE throw us dirty looks when the server asks you about the rest of the order!!! You guys fucked up, not us. 

Apparently we'd become an inconvenience at that point, but more than that, we'd had it with the repeated shitty service. So we told the chef just to cancel the order, as we didn't have time for them to un-fuck themselves and feed us in a timely manner. 

I will NEVER come back here--gift certificates or not. I haven't the time nor the patience to repeatedly venture on in here, hoping that they've finally hired some new people and figured their shit out. It isn't even like it's convenient for me to get up there--I live in South Reno and this place is up by the Galleria/Costco in Sparks. 

There are WAY too many decent sushi places in town (for approximately the same price) to expend the energy it takes to NOT throw a shoe at the chef when she shoots you dirty looks, because she's held accountable to do her job. 

Sweetie--if this is that difficult for you, maybe you should go work the McFryer instead. 

I understand that ANYBODY can have a bad experience somewhere, even at a place that has an average of five stars on Yelp. It happens, But to consistently be this bad? That almost takes effort.

wWSLAJIJaMUQDuVMJRDmDw,4,"Located on Hillsborough Ave across from Sanwa Supermarket, Yummy House China Bistro stands out as a Chinese restaurant for it's modern decor and clean style of cuisine. 

Note: If you've ever been to the original Yummy House on Waters Ave, this one is much finer than that location (fyi is closed down for good unfortunately). Don't expect cramp seating, laid back service, cheaper prices (3 for $22 Menu ), and fortune cookies at the end of your meal like it did there. 

First impression is the modern decor and large host counter. We were seated right away at 5pm. The tables are round and if you have parties of 10+, you can opt for the tables with the lazy Susan in the center. 

Their menu is extensive but with the help of TV monitors near the entrance way, it'll surely entice you to order at least one thing off of their elaborate photo reel. They have a specials menu that can help you fine tune your selections. We had a party of 6, so we agreed to do family style, which is traditionally order enough food for everyone to share. We ordered off of the specials menu. We went down to the basics: soup (Bistro Hot & Sour Seafood), fried (Salt & Pepper Calamari), spicy and savory (Spicy Hunan Beef & Spicy Szechuan Tofu), and starch (Everything Fried Rice). 

Everything was delicious except I didn't expect the Spicy Szechuan Tofu to be fried. I'd have exchanged it for Mapo Tofu, which is steamed and succulent Tofu in a spicy/sweet/savory sauce. I liked that the server brought out the soup first and we all got to share it in small bowls. The rest of the entrees gradually came. The Everything fried rice was a hit because it had seafood, meat and veggies that paired well with everything we ate. Prices for each entree averaged about $12-$13, which is typical for a finer experience. Ask for the chili oil to spice things up a bit. 

Service was attentive, but to a minimum. The server takes your orders, but someone else refills your waters. Before the server would leave our table, she wouldn't ask if we needed anything else. Once we had all of our food, we were fine. In the end, we were satiated and would come back again.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I was pleased with everything. The bartender was quick to greet me and take my order even though she had three other tables. When I asked for a self-service kiosk, she went and got me one with expediency. She also checked on me twice to make sure everything was ok and to see if I needed any refills. She was very nice and a diligent worker.

I ordered a Royal Burger which comes with cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, pepper, two strips of bacon, and a sunny side up egg. I asked for Provolone cheese instead of cheddar, and also asked that raw onions be added and it be served on an onion bun as well. I chose ""some pink"" for my burger (you can choose either ""no pink"" or ""some pink""). Instead of the bottomless fries, I ordered bottomless Caesar salad.

The burger was cooked perfectly. I have had Red Robins either undercook the burger or overcook it. But this was just right. The Caesar salad was served with a lemon on the side and had a very large crouton. I could not taste any Caesar dressing. The waitress said it comes on the salad, but she happily got me an extra cup.

I was surprised my drink came with a straw. I eat out a lot in California, and there, the restaurant cannot give you a straw unless you ask.

In the end, I paid on the kiosk on the table, which made checking out fast and easy. I left her a tip and was on my way.

Here's my issues... Being the snob that I am when it comes to Breakfast Burritos is the first one.


Here's what I know.
  The first time I went, the guys that think they know what they're doing in back chopped up the eggs so much with the carne assada that it looked like a mush mash of something that I didn't order..  There was no taste or texture of eggs left after that nucular assault by way of choppy metal spatulas on common sense....

So today I decided to give it one more chance.....  I ordered another one this time without any meat just so my mind could go to that happy place knowing I'm eating eggs in the morning, no potatoes but added rice instead, some sour cream, and pico de gallo......ready........$7.97!!

Come'on guys...  It was average at BEST. 

I know you just opened but you can't charge that much for a meatless breakfast burrito.  You just can't do that when your carne asada breakfast burrito is under $6.00.

The options are pretty broad but i already knew I wanted the sirloin steaks. It is very easy to use their website to customize your orders. For example you get a salad but my son won't eat onions so I put down not to put them on the salad.

The sandwich itself was absolutely mind-blowing; hands-down the most delicious Reuben I've ever had (trust me, I've tried a lot). Get extra napkins though, because the Russian dressing literally oozes out of the rye in the best way possible.

Fries were decent, but I was already pretty full from the sandwich and I could have gone without them. After looking around, I noticed that many people subbed the fries for either fried cheese curds or corn nuggets, which I plan on doing next time.

The lemonade was also delicious-the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I was expecting it to taste like your typical, artificial lemonade, but it had actual pulp. It tasted fresh without feeling like you just ate a lemon straight up.

Service was extremely friendly despite how busy it got and I never felt rushed.  Luckily, we came at around 1:30, so we got seats immediately, however, after 10 minutes it filled up quick. Even so, orders were flying out of the kitchen and no one had to wait long for their food.

A best bet is to go with a combo plate (entree, rice, soup, spring roll, and a crab rangoon). I tried the sweet and sour chicken and it definitely didn't disappoint. The sauce was just tart and sweet enough without being sticky/heavy like a lot of other places. I also liked that they used chicken breast instead of breading and frying any cut of chicken. The breading was just right-not too much there where you get bites of just breading. Fast service (we ate in).

ERSpdtYzsZsV4rKebfZAMQ,3,"Slight upgrade for tonight's dinner here - my 6 year old LOVES it here - and I am a sucker so, of course, we went.

She knew immediately what she wanted to get.
Lobster & Crab mac 'n cheese.  $24 smackaroos.  Ouch.  Thank god it tasted really good tonight.  Sometimes, I swear, it tastes fishy.

I got a $9 plain-ole hamachi maki.  6 tiny pieces.  Ugh.   For that price Doma or even Morimoto are a better deal for freshness as well as price.

Dessert, of course, was the small $13 chocolate fondue.  This time we were smart enough to ask for ""no melon"" (who dips melon in chocolate?).  The fondue itself is delectable and the small is big enough for 3 people easily.  This time, also, the pound cake was not stale.  Thank G-d!

Service was just OK.  The owner/server (maybe she's not the owner but she was acting owner-ish) kindof ignored us and seemed annoyed when my little one dropped a piece of penne on the floor (though I can't say I blame her -but you could at least FAKE that you were happy to see an actual customer on a DEAD Monday at 5 PM.)

My little one and I listened to the friendly bartender count bottles of flavored vodkas in preparation for restaurant week.  

Finally more customers came - a couple in their 40/50's were MAKING OUT at the bar at 6 PM.  We left soon after.

This restaurant features big windows covering from the ground to the high ceilings, which brings a lot of natural lighting into the open dining area. The tables were spaced out with social distancing in mind and it was evident that Wild Wasabi is diligent in adhering to CDC guidelines during COVID pandemic. 

The shrimp shumai appeared and tasted like they were not made in house and were just simply steamed from frozen. They tasted like they were steamed a minute too short as a few tasted slightly cold in the center. I would not recommend the shumai. The squid salad was good, it tasted light and fresh. Overall, I thought the sushi was above average in terms of presentation and flavor. The sushi appeared like they were rolled with finesse. The fireball roll tasted creamy and spicy. This-is-how-we roll was rich and I liked that the shrimp tempura brought a nice textural component to the roll. The shrimp tempura was fried perfectly and was surprisingly still crispy after appearing to be drenched in spicy sauce. 

Service was good and attentive. Food came out slightly slower than expected considering the dining area was less than half filled.

I opted to make my own stir fry with egg noodles, chicken, onions, pepper, mushrooms, eggplant, scallions, thai basil,  with lemon-miso sauce. The food wasn't necessarily ""fast"" but it's understood because it's all made fresh when you order. My meal was $9 and change and I was just about fully full by the last bite. I really enjoyed the flavor of my stir-fry; I think the sauce almost made it taste cheesey... but regardless, it was tasty. 

My only tip would be to avoid getting thai basil, I think. (See here: about half way through my meal, I got that teeth-drying effect you get when you eat cooked spinach... you know? Well, I guess that came from the Thai basil so I would recommend not getting that added next time. 

If the portion was a little smaller, I might have been able to stomach their smoothie of the month/week(? I forget.) I can't even remember everything that was in it but I do remmeber almonds, honey and bananas.... yum!

GkMMMJdRzAcLCX-c7Knr2w,5,"Deciding to try out this cute French restaurant during Restaurant Week in Philadelphia with my husband, I have no regrets. In fact, I am happy that I got to try this restaurant out and would definitely come here again in due time. 

I had put in a reservation on OpenTable and although I was supposed to be there at 7:15 pm, I called the restaurant and said that I was running late. We eventually arrived 15 minutes late and in turn had to wait 5 minutes for our table to clear. But no worries! It gave me a Chance to Check-In and take in the atmosphere of what this restaurant had to offer. 

Our waiter's name was Richard and he gladly explained to us what the dishes that we were trying to decide on were. This being the first time trying French food, I was glad that I tried the Fishermans breakfast as my app, the duck for my main course, and the lemon tart as my desert. All of which were very tasty! My husband in turn ordered the escargot, the rabbit, and the chocolate mousse cake, all of which he was very satisfied with. The only complaint that he had was the escargot was a little too salty but other than that, everything tasted divine. 

The service was to match! Richard made sure that our glasses were filled with sparkling water and checked in on us if we needed anything consistently. It made both my husband and I feel very welcomed! There was even some sampling of baked bread on the house that was handed out for us to try by another fellow waiter. 

All in all, I rate this restaurant to be 5 stars. It's great for a date night or a distraction for everyday life, and it makes you feel fancy that you are eating something so elegantly presented. I'm glad I brought my husband here for our night out and we will definitely show our faces there again soon!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I love going to Atomic for lunch... my mom works right down the street and we meet here often because it's in the middle of both of us. I used to get the fish tacos but last time they tasted really, really funny so today I just went with the cowboy chopped salad. It comes with iceberg and romaine lettuce, pico de gallo, corn, black beans and guacamole ranch. It wasn't really chopped so I'm not sure about that, but I liked it! I was really jealous of my mom's lunch though and I was lucky enough to score a few bites of it. She had the pulled pork cubano and it was shredded pork, mexican cheese, pickles, lettuce, pico de gallo & chipotle mayonnaise - the pork was so tender & juicy and the mayo melted right into the bread. I feel a little guilty after describing that one! Top it all off with a glass of chardonnay and that's a damn good Friday afternoon!

Table was ready when we arrived. Waiter told us the deal: family style dinner at the table -- don't have to get up and do a buffet or anything -- when we run out, they bring us more. Sounded great. 

Not five minutes later and the food started rolling out, covering the entire table. There was fried chicken which was amazing, beef brisket, ham with pineapple, mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, silly good macaroni and cheese, cucumber salad, house made slaw, some apple sauce that was delicious, and a basket of bread. 

I doubt I'm missing anything, but it was all really good. 

The serving sizes/bowls are smaller as the rounds go by, but if you ask for the larger bowls they will bring them out. Also, they let you take leftovers with you, which is not usually the case on an all-you-can-eat deal.

We had difficulty tracking her down even though the restaurant was not particularly busy.  I would definitely go back here again though. I recommend going when they offer 1/2 price appetizers or margaritas.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Come here and you'll find that magic combo of loving both the menu AND the staff. Gomez BBQ is a great example of passion turned concept. They switch up their menu from time-to-time and are always experimenting and interacting with customers.

I've tried: the Tasso ham and cheese, specially-seasoned chips (seriously you need to get these as your side), and the root beer float with smoked vanilla ice cream. YEAH YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Every Wednesday this summer. Tell your friends. 

What makes them different? They use all locally-sourced products. They even use their City Market neighbor Circle City Sweets for bread. And they slow-smoke. As in, it takes about twenty hours to do. #Patience

Ckcy8TYOinraDoALmUB9DA,3,"Kim's offers Americanized Chinese food at cheap prices, good for students or others living on a budget.

The unadorned white truck, parked right across Walnut street from Huntsman Hall, and right next to the Penn Recreation Center, is a bit sketchy from the outside. But the lady inside is sweet, and the business is legit.

Speaking of sweet, so is the food. Expect overly sweet, saucy, fried, Americanized Chinese food here (e.g., orange chicken or broccoli and beef). Think Panda-Express-type quality. I wasn't a huge fan, but your taste preferences may vary.

Of course, the best part is that meals here are just around $6, which is pretty nice if you're trying to manage a budget. Though keep in mind they only take cash, so make sure you have some on hand.

7Vszl2XdkBALDBZIIUD7Bw,4,"My first foray into Ethiopian food was right here at Zagol in Reno.  I've read the other reviews and found that some of the service problems seem to be solved (or perhaps we were simply there on the right day at the right time!)

We tried the vegetarian combination (my friend doesn't do meat, sadly for me).  However I can be quite happy with vegetarian and th combination worked.  There are four dishes on the interesting platter made of sponge-like thin Ethiopian bread.  One is a cold salad (tasty and unusual) and the other three were a carrot/onion/ginger combination (hot) that was very good as well as two different starchy dishes (hot, one spicy the other not) made of peas and vegetables in a mashed-potato like consistency.  You eat with the bread of course (no utensils unless you ask as mentioned prior).  I liked to take a scoop of two of each dish with each mouthful of bread.

I really enjoyed the entire dish.  We also tried the two Ethiopian beers; the ""Dark"" and the ""Light"".  Both also very good.  The light was a lot more flavorful than your run of the mill light beer, and the dark was rich and sweet with a good mocha flavor.

Service was just fine.  Very friendly Ethiopian woman served us and she was humorous and welcoming.  The atmosphere is trendy and city-like and we enjoyed it; the restaurant has hardwood floors and tables (no booths) set a good distance apart from eachother.  I imagine it could get loud in there but there were only five tables in use by the time we left and only two when we arrived.

To sum it up, four stars, I would absolutely return.  Perhaps I will get myself one of the appetizing-looking beef dishes next time!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I said ""no I only wanted a spicy chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese and a small strawberry milkshake"" and I had a coupon for the sandwich and that it still shouldn't be $8 and some change. She said ""well what kind of sandwich is the coupon for?"" ..I said ""it's for a regular or spicy chicken sandwich""..she then asked a manager for the card and he scanned his card and took off the milkshake instead of sandwich..after that was corrected to him taking off the sandwich instead of the milkshake she seemed a little flustered...and didn't offer me a sauce for my chicken sandwich. The sandwich was served fast tho' and the person who served me my sandwich was polite and did get me the sauce that I wanted.

ZGrPtjoiLvDtnpyKbRZM_w,3,"Well, one positive is that they provide half way decent deals for being a repeat customer. The negative about this particular shop is that they've slipped noticeably since COVID started. Tonight was no exception.

Since I'm still doing the Eastern Orthodox fasting thing for less than another week (Easter is may 2nd this year) , it's all aboard the Lettucehead Express once again. Enter the veggie Stromboli and a loaf of garlic bread. 

Stromboli is huge! Queen Bee doesn't like the end piece so I obliged her and took it myself. I don't blame her; the last 3 inches of that bugger were nothing but bland dough. No slightly sweet aftertaste, no real chew factor, nothing: a mouthful of bland baked flour! Blech!!

Fillings were plentiful enough once we got away from the end; onion, olive, tomato, peppers, mushrooms, etc. with a fairly decent (albeit not generous) amount of mutz. At least they don't use the cheap crap...

They give a small cup of sauce for dipping/dunking/etc. Probably one of the more simple and outright bland marinara sauces I've had in quite a long time. It tasted like a can of 7/11 with basil and a bit of garlic tossed in with very little else. Just let it sit on a burner for a few hours and that's it. Yawn!!

Garlic cheese bread was simple, straightforward and was less crispy or crunchy than I would like. Not soggy either, but the bread in FL ain't the best...so add some mutz, margarine and garlic powder. Yet another yawner! 

Last note is that I got contactless delivery. Just ring doorbell and go. Well, I don't expect delivery people to be the best and brightest among us. However our hero put the two boxes on my little step directly against my screen door. So when I opened it, I had to do so carefully so the food didn't go flying. Instead, it took a slightly smoother landing on the ground several inches below the step.  

At the rate this place is going, I kinda think that I may not bother with them again.  I'm sure Nicole and Chris have a bit of an issue finding good help just like most food service establishments are.

Chicken shawarma is excellent and authentic.  The garlic paste is very good - they will put it on your sandwich but do not sell it nor will they give you the recipe.

Our server was friendly, but they don't waste too much time chit-chatting. I ordered sausage patties with eggs, and my boyfriend got the hungry person breakfast.

I think the prices are fair. Everything is under $10 except the hungry person breakfast, which was $10 and change. You do get a good amount of food.

Let me tell you why. Most places that serve wings include celery and/or carrots with your wing order. Duke's charges you an extra 69¢. I'd think they would include that since they charge $13.99 for 12. Yes, I have to be nit-picky since there are so many restaurants in the area that specialize in wings. This was the first thing out of my husband's mouth when I delivered him the wings last night, and I have to agree.

With all of that said, I liked everything that I've ordered. The first visit was a takeout order for my mother. I shared some of the wings with her and they were super tasty. We picked the garlic buffalo on naked wings. I think we liked that one the best. We also had the Sharpshooter Shrimp which were breaded and tasty. A little larger than other places and they still had the tails on them. The boom boom sauce was average. 

Our second visit was just as great. I decided to try the Spiked Strawberry Lemonade which is on their specialty drink menu. It was very good. A nice natural strawberry taste which I'm guessing is from the muddled Plant City strawberries. I'd love to see a strawberry mojito on this menu one day. That would be even better. The fresh strawberry on the rim of the glass was a nice touch. Yes, they have more than just beer. They have many craft beers on tap. A list of them would be helpful for future visits. 

We also got the corn nuggets as an appetizer. These were served piping hot and were delicious little sweet corn bites. I'd order them again. We also split an order of 12 wings with 2 different sauces. The garlic parmesan didn't really taste like anything, but the wings were crispy and good. The other half were done in Duke's Way which is their Duke's blackened seasoning rub with a medium heat level. This was really, really good. It was spicy and delicious. Not spicy hot, but had a good amount of heat that I was able to tolerate. I saved some for my husband and got him a takeout order of breaded wings with their Nuclear wing sauce. He liked them but said that they weren't as hot as the ones he's had a Buffalo Wild Wings (whatever their highest level is). He did like the taste of the Duke's blackened rub as well.

I would definitely go back for future visits. We've already been twice since they opened. The service was excellent each time. They greet you as soon as you enter, and it's service with a smile. I guess you can say Duke's has gone corporate. They started in Plant City and now have a corporate office in Lakeland. They've opened other locations in Florida and are still growing. I like the honky tonk vibe, and they have live music on the weekends. The Daisy Duke outfits that the staff wear are cute. Everyone is super friendly.

As you can clearly read above this is a great place to get your food, drink, and happy on. The happy hour selection is expansive and diverse. Sandwiches, side plates, share plates. I always order the salmon sandwich (sometimes wrapped in lettuce), the chimichurri fries are a delectable option as well. Want to share? (I know you can share the chimichurri fries but why would you-they are hoard worthy, meaning you won't want to share)  Back on track, want to get a plate that can be shared among friends? Grab the Prime Beef Fondue or the Tavern Veg Plate (awesome selection), or the wings, or the... or the... or the....

Maybe you are here to drink your calories? You are in luck. There are several mixed drink selections on the happy hour menu. My go to is the Shoot the Breeze for $5.00 (44 North Nectarine, Luxardo, honey syrup and lemon juice, served with rosemary). I have dabbled with the Ginger Marg (Lunazule Blaco, muddled ginger, triple sec and house mix) and the Cucumber Refresher (Hendricks Gin, muddled cucumber, sweet/sour mix, and soda). I always return to Shoot the Breeze because vodka is my go-to. But if you are a tequila or gin person, go for it! (Wine and beer selections too.)

The service is pretty consistent, until it gets busy and then it is hard to track someone down. I have sat at the bar a few times and the pillars (you will know what I am talking about when you see it) often hide you and you barely get service. Those seats are awkward so when I sit there I have an extra amount of time/patience. It can get hopping. Table service tends to be a bit more spot one for whatever reason. I have worked in the industry so I get it, you can get slammed. I go for happy hour so by the time service tends to lag a little, I am well into my happy.

As far as full dinner menu goes, I have less experience in this neighborhood. The wedge salad, prime rib dip, salmon and tavern burger haven't disappointed. My father has had a steak here a few times but I am unable to speak to this. Know there are several steak options. Often times if the steak experience is bad, my father won't comeback for dinner. We have been here twice and he has ordered two steaks...

We were having a very special celebration and in New Orleans, we do that over food. Mom opted for the buffet. Whole fried catfish, pasta,  salad, the best artichoke casserole and the absolute best gumbo I've ever had in my life - and I grew up eating gumbo. It was shrimp and okra. Thick, hearty, seasoned to perfection and so delicious! I had the fried seafood platter with a side of greens. Oysters, shrimp, catfish fillets! So delicious and fried to perfection! Too much for one person to eat so half of it came home with me and it was only $25. 

The staff was incredible! We were warmly greeted by a beautiful and friendly hostess who, as it turns out, was Ms Leah Chase's daughter and also the manager.

I had the Brisket Ramen, which had a decently flavored broth, plenty of noodles, 2 pieces of what seemed to be half-smoked half-roasted brisket, and a very good matzo ball.  I think my issue with the food was that more authentic places just do it better.  Ramen is all about the broth, and the broth seemed to be missing something.  Also, the soy marinated egg did not have nearly as much flavor as other ramen joints.   3.5 stars for the food.  

The one thing that made me not want to come back was the service.  While the food came out quick (a little too quick if you ask me), when we were getting towards the end of our bowls, they brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.

      For vegetarians there is an open salad bar that includes romaine, iceberg and spinach, eight varieties of dressing, fruit and all toppings necessary for a hearty baked potato. Accompanying the salad bar are two soups of the day, one usually being delicious crawfish and corn.
      If you're in the mood for more traditional plates they offer meals such as eggplant Parmesan, hamburger-steak and onions, fried or grilled shrimp pasta over fettuccine, grilled tuna, 16oz ribeye steaks, and  giant seafood platters--all meals not served over portions of pasta include two sides. 
      The dining room is big enough for large groups (such as volunteer workers or parties) and more intimate seating is available around the bar. The bar serves bottle beers, wine and mixed drinks and for those looking to meet after work or watch a game their ""Friday night special"" cannot be missed: a variety of appetizers and seafood served with red gravy and tartar sauce. 
       Tony's is a casual place with a cafeteria-style layout. You order from a counter by the front kitchen and sit where you like, when the food is ready they call your name over a microphone and you pick up your trey. The staff is friendly for the most part, especially at the bar, and dishes/clean up can be left on the tables for pick up. 
      For dining out, togo orders can be made over the phone or in person and a pick up window on Pelitere St is open for convenience. If you need delivery they operate through a local service called ""road runner"".
     All in all, a good place.

04ix1Ea3_3aR84BnKUV38w,3,"I had a devil of a time finding a Thai restaurant that was open for a late lunch (or open at all) and finally came to grab a seat at La Thai.

i was really looking for a little more authenticity from my meal so I cannot give them any higher than a 3/5.  Luckily the ingredients were very high quality which got them the extra 0.5 points.

I eat the same thing almost every time:  Spring rolls, Tom Kha, Pad Thai (very spicy).

To La Thai's credit they gave a complimentary eggplant in teryaki which was very good.  Very good balance of salty and sweet.  I'd order that one again for sure.

Spring rolls were average.  Good but not great.  No problem.

Tom Kha was a little watery.  It had plenty of chicken which was nice but I prefer my tom kha a little more creamy and rich.  This is the first time I've had tom kha with carrots.  If I had to guess they missed the fish sauce part of recipe.  Nice little variation which overall did not affect the soup positive or negative.  

Pad thai was just not impressive at all.  The noodles were a little thin for pad thai.  I like the wider noodle and I especially like my pad thai noodles to be a tiny bit sticky on the plate.  They got the sticky part correct.  As far as taste this dish is  far too sweet to considered good pad.  Again, carrots were added.  No significant affect.  My absolute biggest problem with this dish was the utter lack of spice.  I used 1/2 the pepper in the spice rack to avail.  

Overall, I gave them an extra 1/2 point for great ingredients.  Don't go here for anything resembling authentic Thai food.  Especially do not eat here if you want something spicy.  Good ambiance.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The signature salad had obviously been sitting out for a while, and the salad I made was as expected, nothing spectacular. I tried the chicken noodle soup (Meh), the pasta and mac and cheese.

Jim's is cash only and it is a good thing I had some on me because two cheese steaks and two sodas will set you back over $30.00! Make sure you have hard currency. I agree with Michelle C., Jim's is a good cheese steak but not the best. The one we had at Pizza by George in the Reading Terminal had better bread and juicier meat. Chick's in Cherry Hill is also better in this Yelpers opinion. Also Jim's cheese steak is slightly smaller then some others I had sampled during my guest's recent stay. I was able to finish a Jim's whole on my own. I was however very full and in food coma for most of the afternoon. Two people can split a whole steak sandwich.

Wife ordered hot tea...server brought a selection of teas but they were all kinda foo foo flavored teas. Server first brought just a coffee cup of hot water but later returned with a small pot of water without us asking for more.I had a Coke and got plenty of refills.

We both ordered a side Caesar salad. It came all in one large bowl and we served ourselves. Plenty of extra salad for seconds. The dressing was a bit too lemony for my taste. We only got a small plate to put our salads on and no plate for the bread so the one plate acted for both salad and bread. Speaking of the bread, we loved it!

The crust was so crispy and perfectly baked, the bananas were the right thickness, and there was just the right amount of caramel to add flavor, but not get too sweet or weigh down the pie. Even my friend who doesn't particularly like bananas or pies wanted another one. 

Coming early is probably the way to go, because things sell out fast. Even after they first opened, while I was waiting in line, they ran out of sausage rolls! You should also be prepared to take things to go, as there are enough seats for maybe 10-12 people, and the place is crowded with a constant line of people. Next time I visit, I'll be sure to grab an extra banoffee pie or two, and maybe try those sausage rolls!",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Stop in on a weeknight for dinner though and you skip the wait with the same great food. Want lemon corncakes with fresh seasonal berries at 7pm on a Wednesday evening? No problem!

3 Sisters Cafe sits just north of the Rainbow Bridge in Broadripple. It's an old house that has long ago been converted into a restaurant on the first floor and another business (hair salon maybe?) upstairs. Parking? Good luck. There are a few spots in the back behind the restaurant, but one of them is handicapped and very difficult to tell... until you get out of your car and curse that you didn't notice before. Don't worry.. we've all done it. Now move your car! Street parking on one of the side streets is your best bet.

Even though breakfast was very tempting, I decided to behave and do the Barcelona salad instead. Chopped spinach, bacon, avocado, tomato and red onion tossed in a pesto vinaigrette with Gorgonzola sprinkled on top. As is the case with most salads, half could have been plenty for me to eat. It was delicious and extremely filling. 

A friend had the lemon corncakes, so I grabbed a bite. Lemony goodness with berries mixed in. YUM! Even though my salad was excellent, I still had a touch of food envy just because her corncakes were so great!

We usually get the Chicken Tikka masala, Fish Masala and their Cauliflower dish. But last night, we decided to try the Okra. That was our mistake. The okra was not fresh nor was it properly cut. When eating fresh okra, there should be a crunch and the okra should have been a brighter green color. It was not edible and we had to throw it away. I am a bit disappointed because the other 2 dishes were as usual, amazing. I am sad to have given them 3 stars as I do appreciate everything else. I will still definitely come back, I just would not order the Okra ever again. I do have the picture of the okra, but the other 2 dishes were so amazing, we didn't have a chance to take the pictures.

I appreciate the owner reaching out. But I should also note the quality of the okra was not fresh at all as we live a few mins from the restaurant. Not long enough for the okra to be soggy.

gBz97Y5dzr_aFyvH6f7SbA,4,"I've never liked gin, though I have occasionally found a good bartender who can make an impressive craft cocktail with gin.  However, we found ourselves going to Vault of Souls, and Gin Joint seemed to be the perfect place to start the evening (seeing as how they are literally a door down from each other).  Picture an incredibly classy lounge or speakeasy - or don't picture it and just look at the pictures - and that's what you get with Gin Joint - beautiful chandeliers, classy music, and delicious drinks.

Admittedly, service is a bit slow, but that's what you get at a craft cocktail joint.  The cocktail menu includes a fold-out gin matrix, showing you each brand they carry and where on the flavor spectrum they fall.  They also recommend if you've never had gin, or haven't liked it in the past, to pick a gin and try a gin and tonic, served in a wine glass with a single large ice cube.  I decided to give gin another shot - I don't recall which one I had, but it was close to the orange peel/cinnamon side of the matrix.  Our friend got one that was more citrus-y.  Both ended up being good, but hers was much better.  I'd recommend going for one that has a hint of citrus.  Makes it much smoother.

The only reason I won't give Gin Joint 5 stars is that the food was really nothing special.  We got a cheese board, which Melissa and our friend shared, mussels in a tarragon cream sauce (one of the 3 different ways they serve mussels), and I got brussel sprouts cooked with bacon.  The sprouts were really good, but of course they were - bacon was involved.  However, the mussels were really sub par.  In fairness, maybe I just don't like tarragon cream, but I didn't like them at all.  Melissa and our friend seemed to enjoy the cheese, but Melissa also got Oysters Rockefeller and wasn't impressed.

In the end, Gin Joint is worth checking out.  If you like craft cocktails or want to try some gin, come here.  Not sure I would stay for dinner - I don't think I'll eat here again - but I would definitely come back for drinks.  One thing though - fellas - do me a favor and dress well.

Maybe because this was not his original restaurant, it doesn't get the attention of his flagship, but my experience was underwhelming to stay the least. In Nashville on a girls trip, this was the restaurant we were most excited about, but left being the most disappointed. We had amazing food while we were here--but this was not it.  The server was far from the ""southern hospitality"" we were treated to at other restaurants. Part of our party did not care for her drink & didn't touch it after the first sip, she was never asked if she didn't like or if there was a problem.  As soon as the server realized we were not thrilled with our meals, she couldn't get us out of there fast enough. Also was our most expensive meal in Nashville and definitely was not worth the money!!",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
GNJmi20jAC8UiGysLo1zpw,5,"I really loved this place.  Make sure you make a reservation, otherwise you may be waiting a bit.  My sister and I didn't know that piece of information going into the evening, so we just showed up.  We put our name on the list and opted to wait in their small waiting area.  There's a curtain that separates that area from the main bar area, so we had no idea what inside looked like and what we were waiting for....other than delicious cocktails.  

They don't like for people to crowd around the bar and want each guest to have a personal experience with the bartenders and a seat to themselves, which I really like and creates for a less-hectic, relaxed atmosphere and a more quiet one.  They also have tables/booths along the walls for larger parties.  I was really glad we were seated at the bar because we were able to interact with our bartender.

Our bartender was absolutely fantastic!  While I can't recall his real name, I do remember he has some nicknames like Dill Pickle and The Big D, which we learned throughout the evening among some other fun facts that I won't mention.  Our first drinks were from the menu, I ordered a bacon old fashion that was really awesome.  I was hoping the bacon flavor would have been a bit more prominent, but all in all it was a solid drink.  

After our first round, we were then treated to the bartender's choice!  He asked a few questions, which kind of liquor we wanted and whether it be more sweet, fruity, or spirit forward.  We had no idea what we were going to get and he wouldn't tell us what was in them until we had a sip.  Mine was crazy good, which consisted of mezcal, tequilla...who am I kidding, I'll never remember what the rest of the ingredients were.  My sister loved her drink as well which was based with bourbon.  It was really fun to watch him make our drinks and provide us with something we wouldn't have been able to order, and both loved.

My fiance and I were both craving Chinese food recently after I finished my shift at work, so we decided to visit Chinatown and have an early lunch. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and I loved the environment of the restaurant. Our waitress took our order (I ordered Chicken Fried Rice and an order of dumplings, and he ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and an order of crab rangoons) and even brought us wonton soup and an egg roll on the house! Wonton soup is one of my favorite soups and it was delicious, and so was the egg roll.

Our food was brought to us very quickly. I had never tried crab rangoons before, so I was definitely excited to try them. Both the rangoons and the dumplings were delicious! The chicken fried rice was amazing...I almost couldn't finish my plate because the portions were so big. My fiance's sweet and sour chicken looked quite appetizing, and it was nice to see that they put the sauce on the side instead of slathering it all over the chicken like I see in typical Chinese restaurants.

After calling to inform them we all had burnt chicken, the manager gave up free entree coupons. AWESOME, right? Not exactly & here's why...  when we went to redeem those coupons, we gave our orders, and were informed we'd have to pay extra for the quac we all added to our meals, however, just days before we all PURCHASED the guacamole they put on our burnt meals.... I don't understand how that makes sense. 3rd and final straw was when I witnessed the manager refuse the lady ahead of me separate bags for all 15 entrees in her order (yes it took awhile, but nbd), telling the girl at the counter the max she's allowed is 5! Whats it matter how many bags she wants? She's a PAYING CUSTOMER... I know for damn sure if 15 separate customers walked through the doors, that manager wouldn't tell them they can only have 5 bags between them.

EEbMhl7RDsRWLbl0ZnnZnQ,3,"I keep walking by this bar every morning, and finally stopped by the other night with my father (visiting from out of town), and my dude. I'm still working out how I feel about the bar - I think I need to go a few more times before I can say anything intelligent. This bar seemed pretty darn low-key, and there seemed to be only one bartender and one bar back around, but on the other hand it was pretty quiet.

So I have to ding a star, and it's almost sort of unfair since it wasn't exactly the bar's fault, but here goes. We arrived shortly after a Wild Turkey tasting had wound down. The representative was still around talking to some patrons, so I eavesdropped while ordering some drinks. He was promoting one of the honey bourbons as (paraphrased) ""being very female driven, because women like sweet things."" While I know this is a very popular trope, I roll with a lot of women who love bourbon, scotch, and all manner of whiskies, and this type of thinking is a tad offensive to a lot of lady cocktail enthusiasts (disclaimer: there's nothing wrong with sweet drinks, but please stop equating it with THE LAYDEEZ if you're in an actual cocktail bar if you want my business). 

Even though I happened to be ordering a Moscow Mule (what can I say, I must have been in a female driven mood that night), I almost wanted to march over to the dumb rep and guzzle my gentleman's Knob Creek just to make my point.

The hamburger/ roll was also tiny. Nothing really spectacular about it and for 9 dollars, I feel like it wasn't worth it at all. The next thing we ordered was the the beer battered wings.

I expected something spectacular because I kept hearing wonderful things about it. But to my surprise it wasn't anything special about it.

urT7ZmQF-ScHpUNBEk3Ucg,3,"Today I placed a pickup order from Ginza after looking around a while at various Chinese places. My boyfriend wanted bourbon chicken, and this was one of the few places that serves it, but what really sold me was the fried banana roll. I love bananas in sushi, I can't get enough of it, but so few sushi places actually make a roll with banana in it.

So we placed our order: Bourbon chicken with a side of fried rice, an egg roll, a fried banana roll, and chicken yakisoba. They told us ten minutes and $38 and our food would be ours. $38 seems a little steep for two dishes and two sides, but cravings are cravings, and we gave in.
We arrived a little after ten minutes later, and our food wasn't yet ready. I figured ten minutes seemed a little too fast anyhow, so we sat for about another ten and waited, it wasn't bad. 

The shop looks really worn down and outdated from the outside, it definitely needs some work done. The inside is small and cozy, there's a nice sushi bar that seats maybe six if you'd like to pester the sushi chef while he makes your rolls. There aren't many tables in the restaurant itself, but they have really nice chairs and the tables seemed decently kept. The whole room is dimly lit, and there's one small television hanging on the wall at an odd angle that seems most useful to those by the door. The classic good luck cat waves at you when you enter, but beyond that, there isn't much décor. The saddest part though, really, is the state in which their goldfish are living, if you can even call it living. There are so many of these large puffy goldfish in one small tank, their water a cloud of murky green. I felt so sad for them and wondered when the tank had been cleaned last. 

Our food was hit and miss. I loved my banana roll, but my yakisoba was almost more vegetables than noodles. I love veggies in my noodle dishes, but I expect my noodle dishes to be mostly noodle. There was a good amount of chicken in it though, and once I moved out most of the peppers and radishes, it tasted very pleasant. My boyfriend however, didn't fare so well with his choices. He did not receive bourbon chicken, but instead beef and broccoli with a small cup of bourbon sauce on the side. His egg roll and fried rice were nothing special, but not bad. We did receive an unordered miso soup though, I'm unsure where it was from, possibly a side to my yakisoba, but it was delightful. The soup itself was perfect in taste, though the portion I was given had way too much seaweed, almost no tofu, and only one tiny scallion. I'm sure I got one of the last servings from the pot or some such, but it's not matter. 

My experience was a four star, but since my boyfriend's was only a two star, we're settling in the middle at three. If you order from here, stick to the Japanese cuisine or you'll be left disappointed.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I ordered the tequila lime salad, which was described on the menu as ""marinated shrimp, garden greens, black beans, pineapple salsa, cheddar cheese & tortilla confetti tossed in a citrus lime dressing and served with a pepper jack cheese quesadilla."" The shrimp were smaller in size but they tasted fresh and were cold.  ""Garden greens"" was code for iceberg.  Who the heck still eats iceberg lettuce? Yuck. Pineapple salsa wasn't there.  Maybe it was the bits of corn I saw?  No idea. It wasn't pineapple. 

Luckily my wings saved the day. I also tried my friends sweet potato fries which were nicely cut, crinkle and had the perfect amount of seasoning. They were some of the best I've had.

Don't order a salad at Flanigans. Unless you can't seem to shake that hankering for 3 lbs of iceberg lettuce. Then by all means...

Oh wait- and the beer list is pretty solid.

EW8ZeM-iqJXIUidk2N3zng,4,"So, my husband and I have been living in our new home in South City for only 2 months. We try not to go out for food very often because it can get pretty expensive. However, with this in mind, let me tell you, we have visited Onesto 3 times since living here. It's absolutely fantastic! It's also a wonderful local gem in which we hope to bring many friends and family! It also helps that we live within walking distance which has been very fun....and dangerous! I feel we may need to practice better self control when that pizza craving hits!

We've had the calzones, salad, pizza, an appetizer, and even dessert. Let me bullet point this for you all.

Calzones: A really good quantity of food for a pretty low price. It fed me while I was in the restaurant and then an additional meal the next day. They don't skimp on the cheese, and their additional toppings are always plentiful and fresh. I promise. I was actually sitting down to lunch one day when a man (i'm only assuming he's one of the chefs) brought in a few crates of produce from which I'm sure came from a local farmer's market. 

Appetizer: We had their local specialty....some kind of rice ball. I'm honestly not sure what was in it, but it sure was tasty!! I would definitely recommend it.

Salad: Great house salad; very large portion when you go with the family size. Pretty sweet dressing from what I remember and definitely a reason to go back again! 

Pizza: Great pizza, but I would actually most likely do the calzone again. :-)

Dessert: My husband had the tiramisu and I had the flourless choc. cake. The cake was really good, but a little pricey for us. I think it was $9 for a sliver! I'm sure that's pretty standard, but chances are, we won't go back for that specifically. The tiramisu, however, was AWESOME. It was huge, light, and fluffy, not too heavy on the coffee flavor, and maybe the best we've tasted from a restaurant here so far. Highly recommend it!

Now, for my explanation with deducting a star. (In case it's not obvious from my other reviews, I like to begin a review from 5 stars, and deduct accordingly. I know some people like to have their subjects earn each star as they go, and just not continue to 5 if it's not deserving, but I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt :-)

The service at Onesto is overall really great. In fact, we've never experienced bad service, just slow service. This seems to be unavoidable at times, and we do understand that. However, it will keep me from giving away that last little star.

Overall, definitely a restaurant I'd recommend and rave about!",1.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

MSOJHzce6D319Abb8_opsg,5,"Whole Hog Café has great BBQ.  My boyfriend and I will get the Whole Hog platter (ribs, pork, brisket, 2 sides and corn bread) or the Ultimate Platter (Same as Whole Hog but with chicken, and extra side and 2 cornbread).  We will also get an order of 10 wings with no sauce if we are hungry enough. The Whole Hog platter and 10 wings is more than enough food unless you are ravished.

A review of the food: 
Chicken- Delicious, you can tell it was cooked perfectly and pulls apart so easily.

Pork- Same as the chicken.

Ribs- Wonderful flavor and cook..

Brisket- This is my favorite part, the seasoning on the rub is amazing, it just melts in your mouth.  It makes a great substitute for Texas brisket when you are 1700 miles away.

Wings- The wings do not have a batter on them, or something, It is just crispy skin and delicious meat.  I normally do not order wings anywhere because of the gross veins and fat and other unknowns in the little tiny part of the chicken.  HOWEVER, the wings here are pure meat and bone.  There is no mystery substance in the wings.  Yum.  We order them plain to use the 6 sauces on the table to flavor them up.

Baked Beans- Great flavor.

Cheesy Corn- I could eat that stuff all day long.  Its cheesy and corny and mixed with some of their amazing BBQ sauce on the table, it is even better.

Corn bread- Average, noting amazing, nothing bad.

French fries- Regular fries, not steak fries, they are closer to shoe string fries.  They do come out crispy though.

To round out the review, This place is amazing.  You will never want to even look at a Famous Dave's again.  It never seems to be super crowded, but it is a worthy restaurant to have a line out the door.

After all, I have messed up a lot over the course of my life but have received a lot of chances to get it right. Thankfully, I was not given up on and did eventually get my life right. 

I came to the Matador one last time to get them another chance, and please my wife. I ordered the Steak Fajitas. When they came out, they looked good. I excitedly took out a tortilla, added guac, onions, and bell peppers, beans and then the steak. I rolled up tortilla into a nice size and took a bite. 

The flavor was good, but something in my mouth just was not working. I spit out the food and explored it to discover that the steak was mostly un-cheawed. I decided to try build another one just in case I had gotten a bad piece of steak.

I had the exact same experience. I even picked a piece of steak and tried it al-a-cart just to make sure. The steak was indeed the issue. It was like trying to eat shoe leather. It was completely inedible.

Just as soon as we could get the attention of the server, we told him of the problem. The server took it back and told us that he would replace it, I told him this time, Id better go with the Chicken. 

About 15 or 20 minutes later, my replacement Fajitas came out. The server came back a little later to check on the replacement and told me that he was going to talk to him manager.

When we had finished, the server came over and told us that we could either have a free desert, or 10% off our meal. I did not say anything to this because I did not want to make my wife uncomfortable, plus we had spent way too much time in here already.

We opted for the 10%, but I thought this was very poor customer service. I had been given really bad food that I could not even chew, then I was forced to wait while they replace my food. During that time, my wife finished her meal and I was left to just sit there and watch her eat. And for all this inconvenience, I was being offered a free desert or 10%!!!

The chicken dog sucked, sucked, sucked. Cold and rubbery and tasteless. Redeemed by the potato roll but the chicken apple sausage was ugly and bleak. Would highly suggest removing it from the menu, steer well clear.

The portions are small. I left feeling like I have had better or same quality of food for less money, but somehow our bill wasn't shocking at all. The clams were delicious, but there were only three. We also liked the wedge salad but it was a bit under dressed. The lobster pasta was very simple and yummy, typical New Orleans fashion with a little bit of spicy flavor mixed in. My husbands salmon was a little bit on the rare side, but it was so beautiful and he said it was very good.

A few months later, I gave it another chance. Several people in the back talking, while patrons were waiting to order. No one made any effort to take orders, just yucking it up. I left.

Four months later I tried what turned to be my final time. The guy up front, who supposed be taking orders was on the phone. He didn't care how many people were in the place waiting. He was going to finish his call. After five minutes, I left. I'll never go back.

If you are in Saint Pete anywhere near 22nd Ave., North, this is a must see! This business is an unbelievable store, deli, bakery, coffee bar, wine cave and much more! I've been to Italy and this is the closest place in the Tampabay area to having authentic Italian food. I drive many miles just to get a taste of this slice of real Italy!

Mazzaro's offers so much from the time you walk through the door.  The first thing you see is the meat market, where butchers cut the meat of your choice. There are frozen items to take home, that are prepared on the premises. The separate wine room has a huge assortment and tastings are available. 

MY FAVORITES:
1. FRESH MOZZARELLA! 
They make ""the best mozzarella"" I've ever tasted! So soft and flavorful, fresh as can be!
2. COFFEE BAR
There is also a coffee bar with items on the menu and all different types of coffees, lattes, cappuccinos etc. What makes the coffee bar so special is talking to the people that are there enjoying the food and coffees. Most people are either from Italy or have been to Italy and are so eager to share their experiences.

There is also a pantry to buy dry food items. these items are sometimes hard to find and always available here. There is a fabulous deli, where you can get cold cuts or prepared foods that you can eat on the premises. Lasagna to salads, they have it all! Lastly they have a bakery with hard to find Italian pastries, cakes, and cookies. There is an attached covered patio where you can eat your prepared items.

A little ways out from the city but worth the drive. Parking lot is a little small and near the road but it was manageable. Inside it is a classic Asian sushi restaurant, pretty decently sized and plenty of seating options. 

We ordered the spicy/special spider roll, a plain salmon roll, a hamachi hand roll, and a hamachi Kama bento box. Everything was reasonably priced and a GREAT lunch deal - highly recommend stopping by for lunch. Everything was round $12 or less. the fish was AMAZING!! So fresh and tasted real good. Was very surprised of their quality of fish and how good it was, especially for what it was worth. 

A unfortunately fault it a star because of the sushi rice. Was very disappointed that the sushi rice was hard and not as sweet/vinegary as most sushi rice is. the lack of flavor is fine but the fact that it was hard and tough to chew really dampened our sushi experience. 

However I lovedddd all the rolls and plates we ordered - yellowtail collar is a MUST!! So buttery and juicy and one of the best I've had in St. Louis. But for a sushi restaurant, I was disappointed in the rice.

ErR7AuUGzFw8SWs-4-khNA,2,"Sad to say, under new owners/management, Tamarack Junction Casino has unfortunately changed for the worse.  To start, they increased menu prices for LESS food, took away earned ""comps"" and said it is all combined with ""points"", that can used as most of us have in the past for free play.
Not sure how things are in Carson City but here in Reno every casino has ""comps"" and value their players with these extra perks. All of them you earn points AND comps dollars.  Now they do send in the mail ""coupons"" for free food but they do not add up to much with the higher menu prices.
Now here is the big thing - many of my friends will play on average maybe $3k to $4k a month or more!  My regular group of 7 (sometimes we are all together or a few of us at a time) would come in play and spending that much a month would earn decent comps for gift cards/steak house (when it opens again who knows) BUT keep coming back due the comps and great employees!  Using my basic math, and average that revenue a year out, that is almost $300k+ a year in revenue for what maybe $42k/year under the old system in comps for this group of 7.  The really sad part is that players that spend much less would earn maybe a few hundred in comps a month and appreciate a few meal/gift cards too.  Bottom line, consider it marketing dollars because that was why we came back again and again.  Win or lose, the comps were a very big deal!
Finally and let me be clear, the group of people (old staff and the only reason for 2 stars) that work at Tamarack are great!  They made the place!  The new management with the changes and their very small ""extras"" will soon see they are losing many players (like my group of 7) to other casinos in town.  It is too bad for the employees, the guests and eventually Tamarack Casino when their guest count keeps going down.  BTW, the slots are tighter than ever too!  Sorry about being negative here because this place was once (pre-COVID) pretty cool!  The new owners can spin this any way they want but the fact is, no comps as in the past, higher food prices and NO pizza in the bar either!

Alright..to the food (and this time I have pictures)! My friend ordered the fried chicken, I went with the grouper, and we decided to split the mac. I mean as they say, a picture tells 1000 words and in this case, it's all positive. 

I'm not a huge fried chicken breast fan (more of a chicken tender girl) but I had to try a piece because of the presentation alone. The chicken was seasoned to perfection with just enough crisp on the outside and a lot of moisture on the inside. My grouper with the crust/bread crumbs was decadent! I saw crust/breadcrumbs because I couldn't tell if it was pan fried or oven baked. Either way, it was very gourmet like with a southern twist. I will definitely be back for that dish again.

We came in for a large birthday dinner for a friend (14 of us).  Our waitress was extremely attentive from the second we sat down.  The ambience in Haven is very trendy, yet inviting.

We were initially impressed with the wine list.  I spent some time perusing and then decided on a French rose' (turned out to be delicious).  Because it was a special celebration, we started with the cheese monger and meat monger platters.  The cheese monger came with 18 different cheeses.  I don't remember how many meats were on the meat platter, but it was quite a few.  These were served with bread, nuts, and dried fruit.  I particularly enjoyed the soft cheeses and the foie gras in the meat platter.

As for my main food - I got the snapper.  It was covered in a coconut sauce, which was very different and flavorful.  It was almost like a curry sauce, but with a bit of different spice flavor.  My spouse got the pork ribs - it was a large portion and the meat was fall off the bone.  The brussel salad was very unique and fresh.  The item that surprised me the most was the cauliflower.

I took some advice from a co-worker and ordered from Divine.....TWICE. As my profile states, I ONLY visit small, local food joints. I was rooting for this place...but..well..

Visit 1) I got the combo plate. The pulled pork was flavorless...greasy...watery..and very disappointing. The chicken, however, was FAR WORSE. I saw simply DISGUSTING hunks of chicken skin in the pile that was on the plate...I LITERALLY. LITERALLY gagged when I threw caution to the wind and gave it a bite. The third meat...well...after that...I didn't try and don't remember. 

Visit 2) I ALWAYS want to give a ""Local"" a second chance. So, throwing caution (and my $$$) to the wind, I decided to give them another chance and order some different things. This time, I ordered a ""hot link"" and a pork burger (when I do things like this, I take the leftovers home). The ""hot link"" was edible; after I cut it open and microwaved it for two minutes. The pork burger, however, was the epitome of everything that could be wrong with ANY food item (once again, I PROMISE I am not making this up or using hyperbole). The meat was LITERALLY BURNED TO A CRISP. I took the patty off of the bun and LAUGHED at the dry ""clunk"" it made when it hit my desk. It was inedible.

- Low ceilings, some exposed to show the structural beams and vents -  a very tight bar area, not easily navigable.  The décor is a bit cliché, very dark, and am not particularly feeling the cougar-ish appeal of it all (literally, there is fake cougar fabric lining the bar banquettes) - and right away, you realize what this place is catering to:

- Cougars, wealthy ones, main-liners, suburbanites wanting a big night in the city, business types, the wheelin' and dealin' types that can afford to pay $12 per uninventive, standard cocktails. (Eight boring ones to be exact - 2 per liquor type, with an even shorter beer list, a semi-decent wine selection and everything is overpriced).

oO4jOsBLwIXqoeuUqPSvHA,4,"There's an old joke that goes ""How do you make a million dollars?""  Response:  ""Start with $8 million and open a restaurant!""  It seems the more that I go to restaurants that I've been anxious to try, the more I see the delays with permitting and hiring and the myriad of things small business owners have to deal with that they just didn't expect to delay them.

So, this place opened early in May for what turned out to be a ""soft opening"".  Turns out there were some permitting issues with the smoker getting licensed which they expect to be resolved any day now, but because of that, they are currently serving a very limited menu of some pulled pork, pulled chicken, and some hot dog/links entrees just to stay open until they get full certification on their smoker.  It's been further complicated because they need both Speedway AND Marion County approval.  Speedway? Check!  Still waiting on the county.  

Unfortunately, these limitations haven't been mentioned on Yelp or elsewhere that I've followed, so I have made a couple trips there, turned away once, and ate from the limited menu on the second.  So, you may have a totally different experience once they officially have a Grand Opening.

The place looks very cool; Nicely adorned, without too much, and lots of tv's tuned to sports channels.  We got our menu and though we were surprised there were only five items for entrees, we decided to stay. 

I got the pulled pork and Greens, my wife choose the pulled chicken.  What was a bit surprising was that these $10 sandwiches didn't come with anything else than some pickle chips on the sandwich.  No potato chips unless you want to spend an additional $4 a bag.  Really?

Despite my frustration, I will say the the pulled pork sandwich tasted really good.  The bread was fresh, the meat was tender and moist, and the flavor was a bit of sweet and smoke.  My wife enjoyed the chicken as well, though she found some of the chicken wasn't ""pulled"" very much...large pieces that sometimes fell out of the sandwich.  And the ""Greens"" were delicious.  Unlike regular collard greens which may have bacon or ham in the mix, there was no meat visible and the dish took on a somewhat sweeter taste than I'm used to.  I asked the waitress about the different textures I noticed (some leafy, some circular/tube shaped) and was told they use kale instead of collards and use the entire above ground portion of the plants, so the tubes were chopped stems.

I appreciate that the owners reached out to me to let me know that they are still in transition (limited menu) for about a week (or so they have been told).  If you are going for the pulled pork or chicken, then stop on by.  They really are good.  But if you are looking for ribs or salmon, or wings, then follow along on their social media to ensure you don't experience the frustration of opening a new place.

It's a small restaurant but it doesn't feel cramped. I came here after work with some co-workers/best buddies ever and was stahhhhhving. Appetizers were ordered but one of my friends showed up before me and ate all of it....smelled pretty good though (heartbreak D':). 

The menu is expansive with options and vegetarian friendly! You have the option to add the protein of your choice to any of the Entrees and determine the level of heat. Proteins include: Chicken, Beef, Veggie/Tofu, Oysters, Shrimp/Coconut Shrimp, Shell Crab,Mussels, Calamari, and Rainbow Trout. The levels of heat are medium hot, hot, and thai hot (not for the faint of heart).

I end up ordering Shrimp Tom Yum (Thai Hot) and Coconut Shrimp Red Curry (Thai Hot). I figured that I could handle whatever they throw at me. I tell them to make it REDUNKULOUS SPICY because as I mentioned in other reviews other places don't get it right. 

-Shrimp Tom Yum- (lemongrass flavor?) clear broth, spicy in a way that doesn't overpower the dish. 

-Coconut Shrimp Red Curry-  yuuuuge , succulent, (panko breaded?)crunchy, juicy shrimp. The curry itself it SPICY! THEY.DID.NOT.HOLD.BACK!! All married together with some fluffy jasmine rice. 

I couldn't eat all of it, it was a yuuuuge portion! I left this place regretting not ordering another one to go on top of the to go box.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The wine list is comprehensive but a bit overpriced. I didn't drink as I was nursing a NOLA hangover but I can certainly appreciate a good wine list. 
The food was really fresh and a nice departure from the pre-wrapped $17 sandwiches elsewhere in the airport. I highly recommend the tomato soup. I also ordered a salad with chicken in it, I forget the specifics but it was delicious. The desserts look excellent as well.

8-g_Ee2c7UClvzkB_2b9xg,4,"Totally unlike your average wing, Korean Fried Chicken (or KFC) involves sweet and spicy double-fried chicken wings. Whereas traditional wings are heavy and greasy, KFC is light with a thin, flaky, crackly crust. It is a true delight that is hard to find. 

Meritage once offered Korean Friend Chicken on Thursday nights. It was overpriced and not quite right. if you want authentic KFC, you have to drive to Cheltenham. Cafe Soho is worth the trip.

Splitting a few bowls of spicy and sweet wings with my buddies with some watermelon soju on the side will never be a bad decision. While there you may also order wings for takeout for anyone who couldn't make the trip with you. The booths and atmosphere are generally quiet and comfortable.

I ran in the door at 2:59 and the grill was shut off, so I couldn't get a cheesesteak even if I wanted to. But the City of Brotherly Love proved that slogan to be true by saying they'd still make me a sandwich so close to closing.

I got my boyfriend the large roast pork sandwich, and I got myself a small roast beef - both with sharp provolone and peppers. The large sandwich looks way longer than 12"", and I thought it was alright. I'm not big on pork in general, so take my review of that with a huge grain of salt.

What that means for this review is that I have eaten sushi from Houston to Miami, and all around the Tampabay area and only Samurai Sushi in Riverview had caught my attention like this place.  

What's different about this place is that, while it does have a number of traditional options, they have more fusion signature rolls and dishes that are out of this world. 

If you are interested in trying something new, try the lobster rangoon, and the wasabi Cesar salad.  Enjoy their fried rice balls, which come to the table automatically - then get the Aztec and Dunedin's dream signature rolls.  

And don't think that quality is lost with flair - the traditional rolls are far superior to most sushi bars. The chef clearly takes pride in his work and it shows in every detail.

Montreal smoked meat is apparently a specialty, but I went for the beef schwarma. The marinated bits of beef were so tender, they practically melted in my mouth. Accenting the wrap were tomatoes, parsley salad, pickled turnip, and tahini sauce, assembled in a grilled pita. It was deifnitely the most unique schwarma I have ever had.

I decided to try a side of the roasted potatoes with garlic. The potatoes were soft on the inside and had a good flavour on their own, albeit a bit on the dry side. This is where the garlic sauce comes in. It is a mild sauce, so you won't carry it with you throughout the day, and very creamy.

Dahlia's also has offerings for breakfast like bagels, scones, and yoghurt. The baklava is incredibly fresh and made me swoon. Everyone working there was very friendly, the food comes quickly, and one of the owners even came over to ask how my sandwich was.

ElqmiINx_mb5BkLgmOiY8A,5,"What a relaxing, hip without being a jackass about it, interesting restaurant going on in a charming part of New Orleans to check out that not every visitor does. You can take the trolley out here if you are staying central and so near the line. 
It has all of the cutting edge creativity (and obsession with pork dishes) meets Creole cuisine satisfaction of many more central New Orleans food renaissance restaurants like Cochon, etc, but the prices are 30% less and their attitude seemed refreshingly less pious. 
We tried several things, and everything was delicious except, ironically their overhyped pork with cracklings etc dish. That was so meh I almost sent it back, and I was a little bummed our otherwise sweet waiter (who pushed the dish) didn't notice how little of it I ate, and offer to swap it for something else. If you have the ability to make lovely slow cooked pork dishes or already have similar dishes you love at other places you frequent - skip this dish. It is like some busy Mom's slow cooked crockpot pork shoulder cooked to mushy, packed into a geometric shape to look chic, and topped with slightly upscale pork rinds to further try and sex it up. 
I live in Austin, TX. where I take cooking my pork with big flavor and melt in your mouth texture seriously, as does many of our restaurants and especially BBQ joints. And Tex Mex places, with their stupendous carnitas. I'd love to treat the Boucherie staff to a 5 covered dish taste tour of my top 5 different Austin slow cooked pork dishes. I think it would inspire the Boucherie folk to either way up their game on that particular dish or drop it from the menu.

9vkJmbWvKBLbUViEkeUp3g,3,"My first impression of this restaurant was on Cinco de Mayo, and you can read my earlier review on that experience (which was very underwhelming as far as Cinco de Mayo experiences go).

However, as a Mexican restaurant, Zapata's gave me a better experience this time around. Mexican restaurants like Zapata's (and Vallarta's, La Hacienda, etc. etc.) are commonplace in this area, and for the most part, they all have a formulaic menu, experience, and service with minor variations which don't really make me crave one more than the other.  Zapata's offers the typical hole-in-the-wall Mexican flare that I am certainly not above nor do I actively seek. Zapata's is generic, yes, but that does not mean it's not ""good.""

My girlfriend and I ended up here on a relaxed Friday night, which is usually when our Mexican cravings kick in. She ordered steak tacos. I ordered a chicken chimi. The chimichanga was not as fried as I was expecting, and in fact looked more like a standard chicken burrito, but by no means was it ""bad."" This food, by default, is delicioso, because of our positive biases towards Mexican food in general. 

Their queso blanco was creamy and did not harden as the night went on. Their salsa also tasted freshly made but probably could use more ""tang"" in the vinegar sense (it favored the ""marinara sauce"" side of the salsa spectrum, in my honest opinion). 

The service in these kinds of places tends to be funnily uniform. Our server was nice, yes, but not as fast, or even as aware, as I'd like it to be. 

All in all, every town, city, or zip code, needs a hole-in-the-wall Mexican staple, and I think Zapata's is probably Oldsmar's. Would I return? Yes.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

eiim6lY1HVsWW3bhQLFDuQ,4,"Located in a strip mall in SE Boise, Off Broadway Deli is known for their deli and specialty sandwiches and soups. They also have a salads, fried chicken, chicken strips, finger steaks and deli fries. 

Show them your Boise State University or military ID for 10% off your order. The same offer applies Firefighters and Police Officers.

Years ago, this business was Hugo's Deli. At some point it became independently owned. For that reason, you will notice some similarities between the menus but Off Broadway Deli has additional specialty sandwiches, their own soup recipes, and they use different seasoning/batter for their chicken. 

One of the reasons why I most wanted to visit this deli is because they are known for their extensive list of homemade soups, which they rotate through. They usually offer two soups a day but for my first visit on 11/9/21, they had three. Homemade soup is one of my favorites and I could happily eat it every day, so I ordered a bowl of each. The soup comes in two sizes, a cup for $2.99 or a bowl for $5.09. I got Jalapeño Bacon Beer Cheese, Bacon Cheeseburger, and Loaded Baked Potato. I also ordered a drumstick and some fries. Off Broadway Deli has homemade fry sauce, as well as regular and spicy ketchup, which is like cocktail sauce. I got a little of each.

All of the soups had good flavor. My favorite was a tossup between the Loaded Potato and the  Jalapeño Bacon Beer Cheese. The drumstick and fries were excellent, as was the fry sauce. 

Off Broadway Deli usually posts their daily soups on their FB page. If not, just give them a call and they'll be happy to tell you their daily soups. Their soup repertoire includes the following:
Chicken Pot Pie
Lemon Artichoke 
Chili
BBQ Chicken 
Sausage & Cabbage 
Chicken Tortilla 
Crab Bisque 
Chicken Cordon Bleu
Cheesy Cauliflower 
Cream of Broccoli 
Potato, Ham & Corn Chowder

However, their food is far below what it can be. Their food presentation is amazing, probably one of the best from Nashville.

Thankfully my SO checked it, so we called the restaurant and they were able to get us a table at 8:30pm. At this point we were already at another restaurant for happy hour and starving. Waiting till 8:30pm seemed highly unlikely, so we decided to head to the restaurant and wait at the bar for the table.

This is easily the most underrated restaurants not only in the Uptown area, but the entire city of New Orleans. Best Thai/Asian food in New Orleans, hands down. I have absolutely no idea why Tulane college kids go to Basil Leaf when it is twice as expensive and not even remotely as delicious as the food at Chill Out. I have been to Chill Out four times and tried out a wide range of dishes. None of them have ever disappointed me. On the contrary, I was blown away by the quality of food I was getting for such low prices! It is worth noting that the authentic-tasting dishes are created by very talented chefs are from Thailand.

Must-Haves: Tom Yam Seafood Soup (tastes absolutely like the ones you would get in Thailand), Soft Shell Crab appetizer, Lad Na, Pad See Ew, Satay

I've come for dinner once and taken the kiddos for pizza lunch multiple times. I enjoy this over smaller places because I get waited on in a comfy cozy restaurant and I don't feel like I'm in a dive. I like lunch time here. It's not too busy and the pizza is hot and fresh. Fresh fresh fresh. I hope it's fresh...otherwise I sound like a derp! DERP! No, it's good. I am picky about pizza and I keep coming back, so there you have it.

They have TVs dedicated to sports but I don't ever feel like I'd be over-run with fanatics. I'd say the ratio of generational clientele is fairly matched, which makes it a great ""family"" restaurant.

The cheese pizza runs you around $12 for a large (or $1.75 per slice) but it's worth it. Flavors are great, cheese & crust have the perfect respected textures. The Caesar salad was fresh and plentiful, but I probably wouldn't order it again simply because I didn't care for the dressing and the chicken looked like my mom pan-browned it....but it WAS fresh and I did finish my plate. I also recommend the white clam pasta and the cheese steaks served on perfectly soft rolls. Yum!

They do serve coffee (for moms like me who somehow made it to lunch without getting a chance to get some coffee) It wasn't very strong, but it'll get you through.

Alternately, they also serve beer and WINE. Yes....the first quarter page of the menu tempts you with grapes and bottles. You're welcome.

I was intrigued by the all-natural, solar-powered business model and ice cream they were putting out. Down in Tucson over this weekend with my wife, we decided to check it out after dinner.

This is the coolest ice cream shop I've ever been to!  First off, they have a great variety of flavors, some of which are not your usual ones (honey, sundae swirl, red raspberry). They have toppings behind the counter that you can add to your ice cream free of charge! If you want something more creative than the usual cup or cone, they also have ice cream cookie sandwiches, popsicles and ice cream tacos!

I ordered a small cup of mint chocolate chip & rocky road, while my wife had the honey & sundae swirl. All flavors were on point and you could definitely tell the use of fresh ingredients. This was a total authentic culinary experience!

Decided to try Jacques-Imos because of all the great reviews and the ""strange experience"" it promised...Well, I dont think 90 minutes wait is a strange experience, it's a bad experience. Everyone says the wait is customary and I don't get that either. if you're in that much demand, hike up your prices because that's good business sense. 

Anyway, the food was okay. The corn muffins are delicious, seriously and this comes from someone who hates corn muffins. The house salad is a plate of yummy baby spinach with a single fried salad. I wolfed it down. The main dishes all come with sides and some of them were absolutely delicious - the rice and beans, potatoes, corn. So what's the catch? The main courses are not avant grade. Mind you this is a New orleans restaurant with manhattan prices so the food better be awesome.

I ordered a carpet bagger steak which is a steak stuffed and seared with oysters - sounds amazing right? And it would have been if the steak didn't have chunks of fat. Sorry, but I expect the cut to be perfect! For what it's worth, they got it done medium rare just as I wanted. I ate half of the steak (such a waste).

My friends had the chicken pontalbo (absolutely delicious) and rack of lamb (which turned out to be a lamb sirloin when it was served - not cool). All in all, it was not a satisfying experience and was made worse by the fact that we waited so long. Give it pass.

Also, you have to take a cab really far out and you will be tempted by the fact that ""maple leaf bar"" is nearby... This bar is also totally over-rated.

As you might have gathered, the staff is friendly and helpful.  The drinks are delicious and use real juices and quality ingredients.  Many of the cocktails are also in the old or traditional style (or new trendy style depending upon how you view it) with bitters and ingredients that highlight the alcohol rather than mask it.  The clientele is a mix of hotel guests, professionals from the area, and often local célébrité--casual and well dressed guests are all welcome.

Saturday morning with a busy day ahead of us I decided we needed a relaxing breakfast first. I have passed by Luvy Duvy's tons of times and for some reason have just never gone inside but when I was driving past it this Saturday the chalkboard outside advertising their Saturday biscuits and gravy special kept calling out to me and I had to go in. 

When we first got there I was immediately impressed with how friendly everyone was, a waitress saw us come in and told us to pick wherever we wanted to sit and almost as soon as we sat down someone was over taking our drink orders. The inside is small and cozy but it just makes it even more of an enjoyable dining experience. The menu as others have said is small but everything sounded delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy and I would have to agree with Jenny P. Holy delicious!!!! I have eaten my fair share of biscuits and gravy before but most places just rank on the ""ok"" spectrum for me. The biscuits were big and flaky, the gravy was flavorful and the sausage was to die for. To make our visit even better they made a pretty mean Mimosa with a cute strawberry on the glass. At the end of breakfast the waitress asked us if we wanted some carrot cake. If I wouldn't have been so stuffed I would have taken her up on that because it looked absolutely heavenly.

The spaghetti tasted exactly like a Lean Cuisine spaghetti dinner, the blooming onion was dripping in grease.  Instead of bring it all back, we did call the store.  The manager offered to just refund a portion of the charges or bring the sauces, but only if we were inside the delivery area.  Since we would have had to drive back to the store to get our sauces, we just asked for a credit.  Our dinner was pretty much ruined. He credited half of the charges back.

If you want quality, well-made food, in the proper portions, Crème Café is where it's at.  

I love the open air concept.  The young chef is off the hook.  He was running around NONSTOP the entire time we were there.  They need to get him someone to help him that's a bit quicker than the other guy in the kitchen since the other guy seemed to move extra slow.

We ordered the breakfast burrito, which used real chorizo and turned out to be really well made.  And the savory crepe.  I'm not a crepe person, but the crepes were really good as well. We asked for our hash browns to be crispy, but they didn't come out crispy.  I think the girl who took our order may have forgotten to tell the chef since she didn't write down our order but tried to memorize it.  

Coffee was served in a coffee press and tasted so good!  It was enough for 2 people to share.  

-.5 stars for not having alcohol and for no crispy hashbrowns.  But seeing how hard the waiter and the hostess(or maybe the owner since she was doing everything and then some) worked, they really deserve the extra .5 stars.

The menu has many different items, all of which are so tasty and able to be customizable. The owners are very nice and friendly! A few of my favorite/must have items include:

Pork & veggie potstickers - wrapper is thick, chewy, and pan fried perfectly! The sauce is tangy and sweet and works absolutely great with the potstickers. A must have every time!

Pho - I've had the rare beef, beef ball, and veggie pho. The broth is unreal! Rich and deep in flavor, not greasy at all. Toppings are great and noodles always cooked perfectly. Comes with the usual (basil, bean sprouts, jalapeños, lime) on the side. 

Black bean chow fun - I literally crave this once a week! The noodles are thick and chewy (my favorite), Black bean sauce is salty and thick. I usually get the house chow fun, or get it with chicken and broccoli. Yum!! 

Walnut shrimp - prawns are HUGE! Batter is pretty light for being a deep fried dish. Mayo sauce yummy with candied walnuts. A signature dish done well! 

Boba tea is yummy. The donuts are always a great sweet option for dessert.

She was kind enough to bring back 3 sauces for me to try since she knew I wasn't a fan of anything BBQ. 
For me, the sweeter sauce is phenomenal! I ate The Who sandwich and loved it! I know, I know, it's just BBQ. Do you remember the last time you tried something new and loved it? It's exciting lol or maybe that's just me because I'm picky. 
Dickey's BBQ is on point! I've eaten there like 5 times since that day. I highly recommend the pulled pork, loaded potato mash, cole slaw, and corn bread.

25Fz1Q8f2MRDQt8wt74p1w,4,"My two girlfriends and I went to Taqueria Feliz for a Tuesday night dinner.  Our experience started out as a 5 star but went downhill towards the middle/end of our meal.

Our server came over after a few minutes give us water, which I loved because I always ask anyway.  My one friend and I ordered the Santana Margarita ($10) and my other friend ordered the Feliz (house) Margarita ($7.50).  Both came quite quickly and tasted yummy.  We were a bit disappointed in the size because it was about three quarters of the size of a pint glass and it wasn't filled to the top.  We didn't mind much though because once we were finished we wanted to order another.  Unfortunately, we did not get that chance because after our meals were finished we did not see our server for over 20 minutes.

We ordered guacamole and chips for an appetizer.  It was a huge portion and good quality guac.  I didn't need to mess with it at all.  Usually, it's lacking lime or salt, but this was just perfect!  My carnitas tacos were really amazing.  There was a ton of pulled apart, flavorful, spicy pork.  It was probably one of the best carnitas tacos I've had in quite some time.  My one friend ordered the mushrooms tacos which she enjoyed and ate all three with no hesitation.  My other friend ordered tacos al pastor and was quite disappointed.  Even though they did not skimp on the pineapple, the pieces of pork were huge.  Normally, you would think this would be good but with tacos al pastor the pork should be thinly sliced or pulled apart.  She also said there wasn't much flavor in the marinade/sauce and left the last one on her plate.

Overall, we had a good meal at Taqueria Feliz.  I was definitely satisfied with the portion sizes of food compared to the prices.  Oh, and Tuesdays were $3 off tacos.  Win.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars because of the size of the margaritas, slow service at the end of our meal, and my friends tacos al pastor.  In the end, I based my rating on my own meal which was above and beyond any carnitas tacos I've had in recent memory.  We would have definitely stayed for another margarita if our server would have come over.  We couldn't even flag him down because our table was located in a small room with only 3 other tables and we could not see the main dining area from where we were seated.

I live close by and it's no secret the pickings are slim for quality food in the area -- especially once you branch out past Italian/pizza. So having a barbecue establishment run by a renowned Philly chef a quick drive away is pretty cool. I just wish the food matched the hype.

For my first visit, I ordered an Oreo shake, bacon mac and cheese side, and a chicken bacon ranch cheesesteak. Aka: All of my favorite things in life. The shake was awesome, but the mac was bland with too-big chunks of bacon mixed in. I didn't feel like the ingredients melded well together. I also didn't like my sandwich much. It was too tangy and soggy for me. I didn't expect a chicken cheesesteak to have such a kick to it.

Undeterred, I decided to order again -- this past Sunday. I used their online ordering form (love it!) to order a ribeye cheesesteak hoagie, no tomatoes, with added mayo (in case of spice) and provolone, fried pickle spears, and a strawberry shortcake milkshake. It took an extra 10 minutes past the promised time for the milkshake, as this time they made it upon arrival rather than in advance.

Once home, I opened the sandwich and was immediately disappointed. Before I even tried it, I emailed the establishment with a photo to show that 1) there were HUGE tomatoes all over it. ew ew, and more ew. and 2. there were no onions.

I then attempted to try it (after removing the offending tomatoes), but it was SUPER soggy and greasy. I didn't notice mayo but maybe it melted into grease? I also could hardly taste the cheese. And the ribeye again had that kick I didn't like on the chicken. Point being: the entire sandwich went into the trash can. It's been two days and I've yet to receive a response to my email -- in which I requested a credit for the incorrect order and inconvenience. I mean, that's $11 just down the drain. Bummer. [I will update this if they respond. Perhaps they're behind due to the holiday?]

I also wasn't a fan of the pickles, but yet again enjoyed the shake. So, thus far I'm 0/0 on their food, but 100/100 for the shakes. But like I said, I want to like the food too, so maybe eventually I'll return and try a meat beyond the steak sandwiches.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

It's only two miles away, but I've learned the hard way that will never fail to get me back to work late. This is located at the intersection of Nolensville Rd. & Paragon Mills Rd., which is basically a huge, oddly-shaped hill. The actual address is Nolensville Road, but you can't get there that way. You have to turn onto Paragon Mills Road to get there, and this little backstreet is virtually invisible. If you miss it, you have to make a U-turn to get back.

That's only the beginning. Once you actually turn in, the drive-thru line is ridiculous. Every time I've been here, it wraps almost completely around the restaurant. They also have a curb that makes the line very narrow. There's no room to swerve or get closer to the menu. One you actually get in the drive-thru line, the service is incredibly slow. There's nothing fast about this fast food. The one good thing is that the service is pretty good when you ignore the speed. I've never gotten a wrong order.

I've never been inside, so it may be better there. It's probably more efficient than the drive-thru. From now on though, I'm not coming here for a quick 30-minute lunch.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The flavors we tried are: triple chocolate, cookies'n'cream, strawberry lavender, peanut caramel apple, blueberry pancake and crispy Nutella.

While the triple chocolate had a chocolate cake doughnut as a base, the rest had a vanilla cake doughnut as a base, with different toppings to convey the different flavors. I have no clue whether they offer yeast-raised varieties as well, or offer base flavors aside from chocolate and vanilla.

My brother-in-law opted for the fruity flavors; he enjoyed both, but if pressed, would return to the strawberry lavender over the blueberry pancake (a bit too sweet).

My husband ate the triple chocolate and the cookies'n'cream; he enjoyed both, but felt the former was more flavorful. I ate a small bite and agree that the latter, while tasty enough, wasn't a wowza.

The peanut caramel apple was awesome, while the crispy Nutella was tasty enough. The thing is, I ate the Nutella one about nine hours after purchase, which likely helped deflate the crispy rice topping under the Nutella glaze. I ate the apple caramel one even later and was super impressed by how deliciously all the flavors came through.

Well, for some reason an ad popped up on one of my feeds and the picture of the food options just could not be passed by.

They also showed a small image of tempura and chicken katsu but it looked more like an after thought and less like a main course. So you can imagine my excitement when I finally conceded and encouraged my husband to give it a try. 
Flash forward to today and we walk in to a restaurant that is averagely busy and a little warm. We are seated and each of us get up to get food. When I approach the buffet there are two sides, one held salad and the accoutrements and the other held hot entrees to include what we could only assume was fish (it was unlabeled), massive tempura battered vegetables, beef and vegetables (which was empty), orange chicken (which had one scoop left and was dried out), salmon, crab puffs, fried rice and yokisoba noodles. I am sure you are asking yourself the same question I was, ""what about the sushi?"" Well that, fellow yelpers, was on an end cap of one of the buffet sides with four plates of either salmon skin sushi, vegetarian sushi, spicy crab and shrimp tempura roll....pretty anticlimactic huh?

I don't specifically remember our first trip in, but our second experience I ordered rack of lamb medium rare (two others at the table did the same) theirs came cooked perfectly, mine was medium/medium well. I sent it back, it came back cut open and then aparently it must have been undercooked as it was then browned where it had been cut open... (though this time around it was cooked correctly when it was set on the table in front of me) Everyone else's meal was great.

On our last trip in, we walked up, put our names in with the hostess, she told us it should be 15 minutes. (she seemed a bit impatient and almost rude in her attitude/tone of voice with us - whatever, maybe someone called her a bad name earlier...) We went for about an 8 minute walk and were back within 10 minutes. We then waited quietly within 5 feet of the door for the next 25 minutes, continually looking at her wondering if/when she'd call our name. She never did, but she kept looking at us and giving us a weird look... (which seemed to match her attitude from earlier when we first showed up) After 25 minutes of standing there, my wife decided to ask how much longer the wait would be as we could see two empty tables inside... and my wife mentioned we'd put our names in over a half our before... the girl was suprised, didn't remember us (it wasn't a busy night) and promptly sat us... (seriously, what hostess watches a couple stand 5 feet away for 25 minutes with NO other customers walking in doesn't at least say hi??)

we were sat at our table and began receiving great service. nothing to write home about, but we were beginning to feel better about the experience and trying to tell ourselves the hostess was just having an off night (though after reading some other recent reviews, it sounds like maybe their hostess has had more off nights recently?)

we ordered our food and a bottle of wine. the wine came, I tasted it and discovered it was corked... not heavily corked as some bottles I've experienced, but a definite off/vinegar taste on the finish... I sent the bottle back, and about 4 minutes later the waiter comes back and informs me that the manager tried the wine, it wasn't corked, but maybe we'd like a California wine better.... ok, seriously, just gonna say it, the manager needs to get more experience with what a corked wine is and that they come on different levels... don't come back and tell the customer it's not and suggest they like a ""California wine"" better... that's just a little much. sorry, but you were wrong mr/mrs. manager ;-)

that all said, the food was great. the prices weren't outrageous and all in all, from a food and customer service experience after we were finally seated, we were happy.

Ca Dario consistently puts out solid and yummy Italian food. I'll definitely go back for a fourth round to try and get a better sense of my opinion, but right now I just can't quite give them 4/5 stars.

Ravioli al Caprino. Tender, melt-in-your-mouth pasta. It's pink since it's made with beet juice but don't let that throw you. It is awesome. They stuff it with an herb and goat cheese filling and top it with not one but two sauces. A small amount of butter and sage sauce that enhances the richness and then a very light tomato sauce whose acidity balances the dish perfectly. I cannot put into words how wonderful this dish is. I've had it more than once and each time it has been fantastic. 

A couple of the other dishes I've tried have been good but not on the same par as the ravioli. Both were specials that aren't on the main menu. That extra kick of flavor was missing. Still tasty but not something I'm dying to eat again. The desserts are most excellent. 

Service is good though on my most recent visit, our waitress told us the specials before all of our party arrived and then didn't go through them again. She also didn't offer to get a drink for our last arrival. It wasn't that big a deal but not up to par with my expectations.

However, when I went, I began to wonder if these reviewers had been to the same place as me! The restaurant is very inviting and concept really interesting, which is why I chose it as the location for my monthly book club. Decor-wise it was a great space and not busy at all, making it a great spot for our book club. I wish I could say that the food lived up to the decor. The bread they brought out was delicious. It had to hold us over for a while, because our food took FOREVER. Since there was a large group of us, we each ordered different types of foods. I was debating among the sushi, the pasta, and the pizza. I decided to go for the healthy option and choose a sushi roll and an order of root vegetables. I chose the veggie side, because the salads were all around $10, which seemed expensive. As soon as the food came, I immediately regretted it. Despite being $11, the sushi roll was tiny. I had been expecting a large specialty roll ala Drunken Fish, but was disappointed with a decent but very ordinary roll that I could have gotten at a number of other sushi restaurants for far less. I ate my roll and was still hungry, but I still had my vegetables. I like to order veggie sides at these nice restaurants, because the chefs have a way of making ordinary veggies seem exciting (see brussel sprouts at The Block). I should have asked what was in the root veggie dish, but considering that the waiter didn't even know it was on the menu, I figured it was futile. I had been expecting a delicious assortment of turnips, parsnips, beets, and other root veggies with maybe some delicious seasoning. Instead I got some carrots and potatoes covered in butter. For $5! I could have done that myself at home. I was very annoyed. Another diner at our table ordered the ravioli and was disappointed at how few there were, considering it was $17, but she left satisfied and full. The others at our table ordered the pizzas and said they were good. They even had leftovers. So lesson learned: if I ever go back there, get the pizza.

At first I was not happy at the sight of the food level but the quality makes up for it. The amount of food I received would feed three adults no leftovers & not overly generous. The  honey chicken has a semi sweet sauce; ginger beef isn't spicy enough in my books but the flavour is enjoyable; the salad roll was fresh, all anyone would hope for in a salad roll.

We ordered a pizza, the...Angelic Spirit? Angel something?  Oh hell, it had mozzarella, mushrooms, spinach, and a really good sauce.  No, it isn't Chicago style pizza, but that didn't make it bad.  It was actually really, really good pizza.  Big fan of their crust and cheese.  I wish we had Angeli's in Chicago, but I'm sure a lot of die hard pizza fans would crap all over it.  Well, guess what Chicago?  New Orleans has some damn good, late night pizza that'll knock your socks off!

Definitely add them to your ""must eat"" list.  We could've stopped in, since we were at Molly's, but we wanted to go back to the hotel.

Angeli delivers until 2:00 a.m., and I suspected that ordering a pizza at 11:00 p.m. would take a painfully long time.  I called, sat on hold for probably 3-4 minutes, making me more anxious and hungry, but our pizza was delivered in half an hour!  How's that for service?  Considering that you can't really navigate the French Quarter by car (or, if you attempt it, I think you're an idiot), I was impressed by the speed of our delivery.  $20 and 30 minutes later, I was no longer a hungry, hungry hippo.

Salmon on arugula was very tasty but the marmalade sauce that came with it was less than a tablespoon's worth. I had to ask for more. No bread came with it, everything a la carte makes it expensive and thus my salmon entree became a salad just fish on Arugula.

Then there was no cream altho I'd asked for cream with the coffee and so we called her over after 5 minutes. She said she'd bring it back - but forgot as she was leaning and chatting with a customer.

The cashier pushed each frame down the belt into a metal piece that the belt went under. Every frame became dented. When I drew her attention to it she said I could go back and get more. I said it wasn't me to go back through the store for her mistake. As soon as I said that another employee walked by and said he would pick more frames. As he was doing so the cashier turned her back to me, began talking to the neighboring cashier loud enough for me to hear. The neighboring cashier looked at me and snipped ""I would wait until they went and got them."" I spoke to a supervisor on the spot who said that wasn't protocol and he would talk to the cashier. Two evenings ago I went back to Ikea to use my birthday meal voucher and shop the store. At 6:30 the line for the food was reaching the soda area. Only one side of food serving was open and the few people working didn't seem to have any urgency about moving the line. Two cashiers sat idle because the line wasn't moving. I asked one cashier what the problem was and she shook her head and said they ran out of food and had to cook more. She suggested I go downstairs for food or across the parking lot to Chic-fil-a. So my family and I walked the store hoping the line would be better when we returned. at 7:10 we returned to a slightly shorter line. We decided to eat.

Food - amazing.  Fish and chips (real chips - not frozen). Fish - double battered and awesome.  Didn't even need tarter sauce - although I used a wee bit.  Fiancé and Father had the scallops and a salad - rocking!   Also the cheddar cauliflower thing-a-ma-bobs....so good.  

Drink - Riesling, awesome.  Tons of solid beers to choose.  We had a root beer spin off that had 5.0+% alcohol in it. Very yummy.  

Service - top shelf.  Never had to wait for anything.  Very attentive staff ALL smiling.

FkA9p8allhxndRz3UbAlBA,1,"I have never been so hostile to a restaurant like this before. But justice must be served. Especially when cold. I will do best to give you my experience and help you to make a better choice.

While dining out on vacation, my friends and I couldn't resist grabbing some sushi and Thai! The little restaurant was right across from our hotel and everyone was ready for a good meal! I, the real foodie out of the group, decided to splurge on this meal. I am very passionate about Thai and Asian food and it was our last night. Unfortunately, that was a big mistake.

The night started on a happy note as our waitress was gingerly taking our orders. I ordered a classic iced Thai tea. That was sadly the only good thing I had. Next, the disappointment started. 

I had two appetizers: 
-Shu Mai
-Calamari Fries

The Shu Mai (small dumplings) were not cooked properly and the sauce that came with it was, I hope, the wrong sauce; because the two went together as well as oil and water. The dough was weak and the interior was cold. Now go to any Asian food lover and he will tell you that dumplings (besides a few special ones) should never be cold.

Next up was the calamari fries. Now if it's one thing that I love, it is fried calamari. I love how when you bite down into the crunchy breaded outer layer, the steam from the chewy inside calamari wafts up into your mouth and the hot fresh, sizzling meat makes your mouth begin to water. 
This was not the case. The 'fries' were not hot but room temperature and the calamari was bland and unseasoned. Worst of all was the dip they had with it. It was sesame dressing that I'm pretty sure they bought from a local superstore in a bottle.

For my main course I went classic and had:
-Red Curry (Shrimp)

By this point I was very underwhelmed. I put down my camera, hopingI wouldn't jinx myself again with bad food. I made a note to complain to my friend next to me, who was trying the sushi (which was actually decent) and told her how underwhelming the appetizers had been. I marched my chopsticks into battle and threw my rice in the curry, and added some requested hot oil (which was hot but not as flavorful). I bent over and picked out one of each item starting with the shrimp. Weak. Then the vegetables, bland. Then loudly sipped the sauce. Just average. And looked up to see that there was no steam rolling up from the plate. I had the curry for 1 minute and it wasn't even hot. The blandness of the ingredients had me asking myself if they just threw the shrimp and veggies in at the last second and microwaved it on high for 30 seconds.

It was not a fun night as I finished it and scrapped the last few quarters out of my vacation piggy bank for a meal that was sub par. And that is an overstatement.

Footnote: I did notice that the main theme of be place was sushi and trying the different sushi I can say that it was okay. But if your looking for a good variation of Asian cuisine, dine somewhere else.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
ek_xbDO-BhNp77gA7Cp8GA,4,"It's one of those times when you finally go into a place that you walk by all the time and think, why did I not come here sooner!?!

If a casual dinner with a bottle of wine, (BYO) paired with awesome Italian food is your goal, then look no further.  Arrancini with homemade sauce, pea and prosciutto risotto, Sunday gravy loaded with meats and a pasta of your choice.  We didn't leave hungry and I doubt you would.

The mac and cheeses, while being adventurous and diverse in varieties, tempted us with the prize winner.  Bacon, jalapeño and shrimp were tasty flourishes but could have used more zing.  Some more cheese sauce perhaps, some raw jalapeño slices to bump up the heat quota.  Personal preferences.  The actual Mac and cheese by itself; however, was spot on.

The arrancini was excelllent.  A half order, enough for two to share, came with 3 crispy rice balls loaded with mozzarella and acoustically crisp.  Sitting in a shallow pool of tomato sauce they sung their siren songs for the last time.

Risotto with pancetta and peas was one of the best risottos I've had in a long time.  Past attempts usually fall flat on seasoning, and while most are cooked perfectly, many peak into the overcooked realm often.  This was both perfectly cooked and well seasoned, with the pancetta lending it's saltiness to aid.

The Sunday gravy is a serious pasta dish. This ain't your pre-marathon meal.  This is the pre hibernation meal.  Loaded with different meats that include a giant meatball, an Italian sausage and braised shredded pork it is definitely going to satiate any semblance of appetite you had upon entering.  Next time, I may ask for some grated parm and some chili flakes, but that's just me.

It takes a little time to prepare some of the items they got but it is worth the wait and the ladies try their best to describe what it is.

Grand Lux Cafe is owned and operated by the same folks that run the Cheesecake Factory, and the similarities are glaring; from the extensive menu, to the decor, to the prices, to the to-go bags. As with the Cheesecake Factory menu, I had the most difficult time deciding what to order. The menu was several pages, and everything sounded delicious.

I settled on the Pasta Telephono with chicken - a ziti-ish pasta tossed with a zesty tomato sauce, a dash of cream, and breadcrumbs. I knew the second it was presented that I was going to need a to-go box. It was a massive serving, and could have easily been split among two people. In my first bite, I was overwhelmed with the taste of garlic. The sauce was delicious, but very very rich. I could only consume about four bites before I was full. My to-go container weighed about 2 pounds, and when I opened my refrigerator this morning to take it to work, I was taken aback with the stench of garlic. Don't get me wrong - I love garlic. I've heard it's the secret to living a long life. But dang. I'm going to reek for days. 

My date and I sat and enjoyed a nearly three hour conversation at Grand Lux, and we were never rushed or encouraged to leave. Granted, had the place been busier, I'm not sure if this would have been different. Nevertheless, I was really impressed by the service. I never felt out of place or as if I was overstaying my welcome. 

I'm not sure if this would be my top choice. I tend to get overwhelmed when there are too many options. However, I would gladly return, if for no other reason that to see Shawn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I assumed that plural pancakes meant at least two, but it actually meant one pancake cut in half and the French toast was a single slice of bread. I just feel the description (especially the ""pancakes"" part) is misleading. If given the choice, the 2x2x2 is the better deal -- go with it over the Big Boy. The cinnamon roll was over $3, and looked nothing like the picture. It was dry and had very little icing. My wife and I spent about $30 on breakfast, and just didn't feel like we got much bang for our buck.

Raised beds pour flowers to the sidewalk surrounded by outdoor seating with umbrella shelter.  Glass surrounds the building in a beautiful fashion and the indoors is lovely as well.  Large, open, airy and bright dining area - oyster bar and liquor bar shucking and pouring out delicious apps and cocktails.  We were seated away from the main dining area in another room because we had a large birthday brunch group.  Our waitress was serine and the uniforms are a cute mix between casual and elegant.  Tried many of the cocktails and enjoyed them all.  Oysters were fabulous as was the homemade biscuits and honey butter.  Tried what seemed like an odd dish and had to trade it for the grits and greens because it was too odd of a flavor profile.  Flatbread with potatoes, fish and egg didn't work for me.  A trade off of dishes satisfied everyone.  For a place that hasn't been open long, Kentons is worth a try.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

xCMeqqib-RpRugduFerYrA,4,"Totally satisfied with our pre-movie dinner. 
My husband had a steak, cooked perfectly and well-seasoned, and I had a strawberry-pecan side salad, which was delicious, although I could have done with a bit less dressing. Most places drench their salads, I should have asked for it on the side.

The margaritas were pretty good (they gave us the whole shaker for each, which came out to 2 glasses full woohoo!) but I must say my Desert Cactus marg was too sweet, especially paired with all that raspberry vinaigrette I was munching on. I wanted to try it because I hail from Texas and I must say cactus pear jelly is my favorite kind of jam, so I had to check it out. Oh well! My husband's pomegranate marg was way better, with just the right tart punch and not too sweet. 

I would have tried the dessert, but I was all sweetened out at that point.

The decor is ALMOST over-the-top cowboy, but I think they pull it off nicely. It's dark and has a nice cozy western stone-cabin kind of feel. It's not too corny and I appreciate the metal artwork since metalwork is actually a traditional Texan artistic/utilitarian medium. The old timey photographs of women riding horses is pretty awesome too. 

I've been here before, (holy sweet potato!) but it's been a while. I don't remember having a bad experience, but I've been away so long since I've been trying to check out local places vs chains.

ez0TRAzRtWkKhwxsHvqmbQ,4,"I am going to give them 4 stars because of the potential....Why do I say that, well I went in and had the fish and shrimp combo...nothing special.   This lady let me taste her potato with the beef, shrimp and chicken in it with feta cheese baked in, I believe it was feta cheese, I only had a little bit, but it was fire.  If it wasn't for that they would get 3 stars at best.  Maybe even 2!

The facility was clean, however, I did notice a little fishy odor by the counter, but that could be a good thing, fresh seafood!  

They only have four tables, so if you are eating in, it may get crowded quick, but that is not a bad thing.  I got a chance to meet a cool guy, and the great lady that shared her potato meat with me.

The food I got smelled good, the fish was very fresh, I had the Jack fillets and shrimp combo which came with fries.  I did not get the opportunity to photo the lady or her food which who shared her potato with me or smell it.  I don't think she wanted me getting that close to it...LOL

They eye appeal of my plate was about average, they serve it to you in a Styrofoam dish so there is no presentation, however that stuffed potato looked awesome, it had chunks of succulent meat sticking out of it and you could see the cheese on top oozing over the white potato, it just looked so creamy and delicious and the taste was WOW!!!  It really made my fish and shrimp pale in comparison of flavor and eye appeal.

My food the taste, the fish, nice and fresh, good fish, not a fishy taste or odor, which lets me know the jack was fresh.  The fish was seasoned right, not overbearing and that allowed the flavor of the fish to come out even though it was jack which we know was frozen at some point and has a milder flavor than catfish.    The shrimp had almost no flavor, it was very mild, and I tasted more seasoning than shrimp flavor.  Some people may like that, but I like that shrimp flavor on my shrimp.  These tasted like some sort of frozen or imported shrimp, just not what I like in a shrimp with no flavor.  My fries well they were fries with some sort of parmesan salt or cheese salt mixture, I just could not put my finger on what the salt was...but it was enough to let me know the fries were frozen at some point and not fresh tasting they just were not that good.  The taste of the Potato, great, it had zing, texture, creaminess and pizazz.  It awaken my mouth with excitement of the tangy cheese and the succulent chicken and beef, as I did not try those shrimps in the potato, she never gave me any... or it did not come with it lol!  It was a good marriage of meats and flavors in the potato.  I have got to try a whole dish of the potatoes by myself.

I am sure they have some good sandwiches, I just did not really enjoy their fried foods!  Perhaps a different fish and pass on the shrimp if you are looking for that real shrimp flavor!",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Much like other reviews have stated there is going to be a wait so just embrace it. It was right where they told us it would be for a Saturday night (45-50 min) but the people in meridian are great so it wasn't bad at all and keep reading...ITS WORTH THE WAIT

Now on to the goods....the food is great folks. My steak was delish, about just what I was expecting...not knock your socks off but very satisfying. My wife got a pomegranate halibut special and was great too.

We started with the wings...and let me tell you they are definitely something you want to try. I know wings and this wing sauce is very unique,  special, and house made. It's distinct, savory, and down right.....well...right. 

Now, on to the two items of greatness that will keep you coming back and craving more...that second round of pure mouth watering bliss....the blue cheese dressing and bread pudding. 

First the blue cheese. I'm just going to tell you now that there is no judgment in this place when it comes to guzzling this dressing down like a flippin Gatorade after a 10k. You are going to want to do it...look around and fingers will be being used as squeegees to get every last drop down the hatch. It's amazing. If penicillin had a smoking hot sister this would be it. Hitler would have traded world domination for it, it's that good. Cummins guys would take those huge stickers off their back windows just for a freaking taste. It's capable of subduing Karen's into malable easy going neighbors you hope to see when walking in your neighborhood.

Second and pretty much last to nothing is the bread pudding. I'm a huge bread pudding fan, it's my favorite and I am a connoisseur of sorts. Vegas has long been known for having some of the best and I have had my fair share from one coast to the other and Kahootz has one of the best...and dare I say it the best I have had to date. This is Meers cafe level deserts lady's and gentlemen...and if you don't know what that is just know it's next level sh!#. Get it...and DONT GET IT TO GO...enjoy it there while the Carmel works its magic on an oven hot sizzling cast iron pan.

Why anyone would stand outside in the unbearable heat to grill their own meat is beyond me. It was so much easier placing our order, having a variety of meats and sides and relaxing. After all, isn't that what holidays are about just relaxing. 

This Labor Day we each enjoyed Two Meat Plates with two sides. As always we had to get your Brisket, which I still claim is the best of BBQ joints in the city. The BF for his second meat enjoyed 4 Ribs. They are so much better then Pappy's. My second meat was Smoked Turkey, it was the first time and it was so juicy and tender. Can I place my order for Thanksgiving with you now? 

We both enjoyed an order of the Schafley Beer Baked Beans with Burnt Ends. Neither of us ate our entire order, which made great take home for later. We also had the Mustard Potato Salad, which is always a picnic type holiday classic. I ordered the Fries, because I have never had them and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I remembered on Facebook you talked about getting a crinkle cut machine and everyone was saying, no that they liked them just they way they are. Your fries are the first thing that has not impressed me. They were OK, but your other sides are so much more unique and flavorful. 

As our beverages we enjoyed your Watermelon Sangria which was perfectly refreshing. Can I have the recipe? I'm asking for a lot aren't I. 

The other day I thought I had found the best pastrami in Saint Louis, but that was before I had yours. I've always thought Bogart's was great and last week The Shack impressed me, but neither of them have the flavor, tenderness and juiciness of yours. Before leaving we got an order of your Pastrami and two slices of Pecan pie to enjoy with our leftover baked beans for dinner later that day.

rG-6xTfKJUDfQdO7K5TUuw,4,"It's hard to find really good Thai in this city and I've surprisingly found two great Thai places on the Westbank. This location is a little out of the way if you don't live on the Westbank, but I really think it's worth checking out if you're craving Thai.

We ordered the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai, Green Curry, and 3 Flavor Fried Fish. The pad thai was very flavorful but was a tad bit too tangy or sour. I've been twice this past week and tried 3 different curries. My favorite was the Green Curry. There's just something so wholesome and flavorful about the green curry and A Taste of Thailand does it so well! The 3 Flavor Fried Fish is SO good and it reminds me of mom's fried Tilapia. It's super crispy!

It appears to be family-owned and there's a super sweet Thai lady who always comes to talk to you when you dine in. The restaurant location isn't the best and is kinda off the beaten path. I wouldn't have known about it if it weren't for a friend's recommendation and I am so thankful, because it's definitely one of my top two favorite Thai restaurants in the New Orleans area.

I am hyper spice-sensitive, so we were careful to order a pizza that did not have any spicy ingredients.  I thought it was the chicken sausage, but upon inspection, we noticed the pie was liberally dosed with red pepper flakes!  (i tasted the sausage independent of the pizza & it was fine.)  when another waitress came to ask how things were, we told her I was unable to eat that pizza, and that there was no mention on the description that the pizza was ""spicy.""  her response?  ""oh, I never tried that pizza.  i'll tell the manager.""  we asked if they could please make one without adding the pepper flakes.  ""no, because the chicken is made with spices.""  holy cow, really?  thanks, just take it off the bill & we'll get a slice elsewhere... ""the manager says if it stays on the table, we must charge for it.""  whatever.  two waitresses, one invisible manager, and a two hour long joke of a lunch later, the appalling lack of customer service training -- which included not refilling the water glass of the customer whose tongue was about to burst into flames until 15 minutes after that was mentioned -- and pietros has officially lost a loyal customer.  boo!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am a server at a fine dining establishment myself, so I quickly took notice to the level of unprofessionalism among the staff such as hostesses on phones or talking amongst themselves about guests. Our server was very tense and did not know for certain what menu items seemed to have dairy or not. Our server also was visibly displeased when I asked to have a pasta dish made vegan or if I could substitute items. Our server came to our table a maximum of 3 times and didn't refill water. In the restaurant I serve at, we are instructed to check on customer satisfaction 1-2 minutes after the food is presented. This was never done at all. We ordered grilled octopus which came out nearly cold and had a strange slimy texture to it. My pasta in tomato sauce was truly the most bland pasta I have ever eaten in my life. I wish I had made my own at home. The tomato sauce tasted like canned sauce and did not stick to the penne at all with how watery it was. The salt shaker I was given was not even a restaurant style salt shaker, but a salt shaker you would buy in a grocery store still wrapped in plastic. The up-charging on their menu is insane. At my own restaurant we substitute proteins at no additional cost, offer different sauces at no cost, and make an effort to accommodate all dietary restrictions and allergies.

k-gidnZLHUkbHoDAOVTqiw,3,"TL;DR: Meh. Overall, my visit left me pretty underwhelmed and disappointed. The service was mediocre and some of my food wasn't completely cooked.

Service: I walked in and the restaurant was dead, which usually makes me a little apprehensive. But it was mid-morning on a Tuesday so not terribly unusual for a restaurant. I then stood at the counter as the hostess finished up her phone call. Not the best customer service but not terrible. I wasn't waiting long so not worried about it too much at that point. Waitress comes over with water and asks to take my order. I've just sat down and haven't been there before, so asked for a minute. I then decided, sat, waited, and played on my phone for almost ten minutes. Finally another table behind me got sat and she came back out. After bringing them drinks and getting their orders she came back to me. Once I received my food I didn't see her again. About ten minutes after finishing I saw her and waved her down for my check. Overall, not terrible but it just wasn't good, yano? Lackluster, dead-inside monotone, and a disappearing act just combined into an underwhelming meal. 

Food: I got the French toast with a scrambled egg and breakfast potatoes. The French toast was respectable. Kind of bland, but not bad. The egg had zero seasoning, not even a dash of salt. Again, makes it kind of underwhelming but nothing unfixable. But the breakfast potatoes. Man, this was disappointing. The ones I could eat were delicious and I would've liked to have more, but the vast majority of them weren't cooked. I don't even know how that happens, but I gave it several bites of crunchy half-cooked potatoes before giving up. The top and bottom ones were mostly cooked though, so I was able to get a taste at least. 

So there ya go, the epitome of meh. Nothing stand-out terrible and I can't say it was a terrible experience. But those potatoes were so disappointing and the whole experience was just not what I'd hoped for. I'd probably give them another shot, just to see.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

DdAnxMBfCXPxilPcxUTEQg,4,"My friend  and her boyfriend invited us here  for drinks  on a Friday night. My husband said  he wished they had asked us while  school was still on winter break so it wouldn't be as crowded. The place is new and just opened.  It was crowded as we expected but it was an older crowd there really no college kids at all so I guess it didn't matter that we went when school was in session. 

I thought  we were just getting drinks so we ate  dinner before  we came here. We ordered a couple  of drinks and got a standing table by the bar. I got a drink with bourbon and banana in it. The bartender warned me that it was very sweet but I said it was ok. It wasn't really too sweet for me but I don't know if I liked the flavor combinations. My stomach kinda felt a little weird after drinking it too. 

Our friends come and decide they want a table and they were getting food so we said ok. Just wanted to get away from the crowd  so that worked. We said we could get like an appetizer or dessert or something small since we already ate dinner.  

Somehow they talked us into all sharing a bunch  of small plates which I wasn't sure if we were hungry enough for but ok. I would have skipped dinner if I had known this. But everything was very good.  They recommended getting the  baked  Brie bites, they were delicious! It was toasted baguette bread with Brie cheese and a truffle honey sauce. 

The crab cake was also very good too. Big chunks of crab with good flavor and little filler, that's how I like them. We also got some mozzarella prosciutto which was also tasty.  Our  friends ordered a flatbread also but we didn't try any we were a stuffed. They said it was good but some pieces looked a little too burnt. 

Definitely wanted to try the butter cake. We were disappointed they were out of the Nutella ice cream that was supposed to go with it, but we got it with vanilla. It was kind of like a lava cake  but without the lava center. They only give you a little amount of ice cream with it my friend asked for more especially cause the cake was a little dry. They brought out more but only one small portion for his cake, not enough for both of us. We split it and tried to make it work though. 

I had a glass of wine as my second drink. Ended up getting sick later I don't know if it was something I ate  or a bad  combination of the bourbon and wine or what. Not blaming the restaurant as it could have been something i ate earlier in the day too  but I did feel weird after that  bourbon drink.

Food was good.  Wings, Korean beef bbq, queso dip, spinach cheese dip, etc on the apps.  Wings were very good.  Both nights I had brussels & enjoyed them.

Good beer list as well as spirits.",1.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0
Mgvq4kIOOhNqIOZ9rVG_Qg,4,"Peg's has a great busy coffee shop atmosphere. They're typically always busy. They have a great menu selection and offer several different options for Egg's Benedict which is now my new favorite thing. Traditionally I am an eggs and hash browns kind of girl, but the Vegetarian Benedict is now one of my new favorites! They put generous vegetables toppings on INCLUDING avocado. Can't go wrong with the portions here either. This is a place that my friends and I love to go after a long night and it's great on week day mornings as well when I am traveling into town for work. Definitely recommend!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We always have great service from the staff here and the food comes out hot and quick. As with any Mexican establishment, the combinations and options for food are endless.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

TukH5Q2l9hcZh8K6M2G-0A,2,"Decided to come out and try it after reading rave reviews online and am sad to say that it did not live up to it's hype at all! 

The place itself is very quaint and the staff are so incredibly friendly and it really makes me wish that I'd liked the food more. Having said that, the restaurant was quite cramped and I found myself squeezed between a wall and another patron, which was not fun.

Onto the food, my friend and I ordered three things to share:

Fresh Rolls - These come out immediately because they've been pre-prepared and are just chilling in a little glass case. I was disappointed that they didn't come with any shrimp or pork filling and they were just stuffed with bean sprouts. This is a personal thing, but I hate bean sprouts! And they cost $4! Definitely not worth it.

Pad Thai with Shrimp - Ah, the famous pad thai. I've been to Thailand on numerous occasions as my family lives in Malaysia currently and I've had pad thai dishes in Bangkok and Phuket a number of times so I had high expectations for this particular dish. But it really didn't deliver. It's very obviously stated on the menu that this was going to be ""authentic"" and ""not-Americanized"" but compared to actual pad thai that I've had in Thailand, this is not authentic by any means. It is quite bland and filled with bean sprouts to the point where it has me questioning the $18 price tag. Also the bean noodles are so weird texturally and they don't soak up flavor as well as rice noodles would have. The dish was just so whatever. There's no other way to describe it. It's not good but I wouldn't say it's horrible. It's just whatever. It doesn't do anything for me.

Green Curry with Chicken - This dish was again, bland and very diluted. I didn't get hit with a mouthful of intense flavor or spices or anything. It was just very milky and the rice on the side was a bit dry and clumpy. The best thing about the dish was that it was filled with beautiful, colorful, crisp vegetables. But the curry itself just wasn't as good as I'd hoped.

I really don't think that I'll be coming back here again. It is so overpriced for such bland food and in my opinion, incredibly overhyped. I know Thai food quite well. I've traveled to Bangkok twice and to Phuket every year since I was 12 years old. Thai food is supposed to be flavorful and rich and spicy and this place was not any of that at all.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
