Oscar's Taco Shop at this location quickly became my favorite Mexican restaurant. It's a fantastic place for a quick bite, or a nice to-go order. Food is always excellent, and plenty of variety on the menu.

Although it's not healthy, their steak/chicken fries are delicious. Basket of fries, with steak (or chicken if you prefer) strips, loads of cheese, and sour cream... it's amazing. Their full order of nachos is enormous - feeds 2 people.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The extremely attentive waitress did not give us even a few minutes to look over the menu in an almost-empty room.  I asked for a beefeater martini and was told they were out of this gin.  I asked the price of a tanqueray gin martini.  She checked the screen and advised it was $8.25.  When the bill came the drink's price was almost $2.00 more.  The waitress, with a straight face, told me the $8.25 was for the gin, the ""martini"" part of the drink accounted for the extra charge???  We each had the tuna tartare as an appetizer.  They could certainly take lessons from Bonefish for this dish.  No wasabi, no fresh ginger, had to ask for soy sauce, poorly plated.

bprumZaRzvwcrLm-Tt047w,5,"This is one of our all time favorite brunch spots. We travel a lot and it's hard to find quality brunch that takes breakfast up a level from the standard eggs and bacon. We used to drive all the way to St. Pete for Metro diner and was ecstatic when one opened up right on Kennedy. 

They are consistently good, and the food is the same at both locations. Service is always EXCELLENT.

We come here so much and bring all of our guests that visit from out of town here. Our NY family and friend foodies love this place. We tried almost the entire menu but the highlights for us are:

-You MUST try the FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES here. I normally think it's too much but it's one of the best fried chicken dishes I've had.

-The corn beef hash is made from scratch. YUM

-Chicken biscuit

-Crab cake Benedict (Really good. Southern flavor and you can actually taste the crab)

-Fish and chips - Delish and I normally don't like fried fish filet.

-The omelets

-Almost everything on the menu is good to excellent. Maybe only the burger is okay. 

I met a few of the owners when they opened up and even though there are several Metro Diners in the US, one owner explained how they pride themselves on not becoming like how ""chains"" normally fail with food and service.

The atmosphere is casual and relaxed.

Today I had the gyro platter, one of my favorites. The gyro meat was spicy and moist like it should be. It's dry from hours of cooking in too many Greek restaurants. The Greek salad is probably the best in the area. I could live on their Greek salad alone for a week. The pita bread is very fresh.

The sandwich itself was absolutely mind-blowing; hands-down the most delicious Reuben I've ever had (trust me, I've tried a lot). Get extra napkins though, because the Russian dressing literally oozes out of the rye in the best way possible.

Fries were decent, but I was already pretty full from the sandwich and I could have gone without them. After looking around, I noticed that many people subbed the fries for either fried cheese curds or corn nuggets, which I plan on doing next time.

The lemonade was also delicious-the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I was expecting it to taste like your typical, artificial lemonade, but it had actual pulp. It tasted fresh without feeling like you just ate a lemon straight up.

Service was extremely friendly despite how busy it got and I never felt rushed.  Luckily, we came at around 1:30, so we got seats immediately, however, after 10 minutes it filled up quick. Even so, orders were flying out of the kitchen and no one had to wait long for their food. 

Dutch Eating Place is also surprisingly homey, despite the general bustle of Reading Terminal Market. It's located toward the back of the market at the 12th St and Arch St corner with U-shaped counters and barstools. You might be touching elbows during a rush, but I found it fun to chitchat with others sitting next to me.

In the hopes of enticing them, I told them when Philly's Restaurant Week was and they agreed to choose a day during those two weeks and that I could pick the restaurant for lunch (YES!). Lacroix was at the top of my list of places to try when an opportunity arose, and so I made reservations for their Restaurant Week menu.

We arrived and were seated at a table where we could overlook Rittenhouse Square. We each ordered different appetizers: I got the mixed green salad (tasty, nothing TOO special), my mom had the caesar salad (THAT was good, and the presentation was pretty cool - gotta love the parmesan curled crisp), and my dad had the fennel soup (another win - but then again, he does love fennel). For our main course, both my mom and I had the Seafood Tajine (like a stew with a variety of seafood including scallops, white fish, mussels, clams over quinoa and dried apricots) which was really fantastic, I love the spices they used in the broth, and my dad had the mushroom risotto, which he finished before my mom and I had a chance to ask for a taste (therefore, it must be good - he usually offers us a bite). Dessert was a trio of petite fours: chocolate banana creme brulee (meh - I'm much more a fan of the simple vanilla), chocolate ganache cake (soooooo chocolately, all you need is that small bite), and fig tart (so cute, so delicious - my fav of the bunch).

Yesterday, my mom and I wanted to have a quick lunch; we ordered the risotto ball suppli which was authentic. The red sauce it was topped with was great- as good as any Italian restaurant. Inside you could find cheese and meat which adds to the authenticity of the dish. We then had salads as our main- they were huge, hearty and the dressings were full of flavor.

The staff is always so nice and welcoming and I love that they take reservations! Sitting at the hibachi seats is always the best experience! The chefs are so talented and fun and I've never had one who didn't make it an awesome experience! No matter how many times I've been there, I always get a smile on my face for the onion volcano!! 

Before COVID, I never mind sitting next to other random parties. However, the last time I went was about a month ago and we still sat with another family. I believe there was 2-3 seats in between us not filled, but I honestly expected 1 party per booth. 

My go to is always steak and shrimp hibachi! I love the miso soup and ginger salad that come with! The hibachi is ALWAYS delicious and full of flavor. I really like the sauces they give you as well!!

I've had sushi here a few times and it was delicious! I believe I've only tried the california roll and the tuna roll. Like I said, 99% of the time I go solely for hibachi.

Come here and you'll find that magic combo of loving both the menu AND the staff. Gomez BBQ is a great example of passion turned concept. They switch up their menu from time-to-time and are always experimenting and interacting with customers.

What makes them different? They use all locally-sourced products. They even use their City Market neighbor Circle City Sweets for bread. And they slow-smoke. As in, it takes about twenty hours to do. #Patience

I particularly liked the snapper so I hope to see it as the catch of the day regularly. Tartar sauce was delicious. Fries were fresh cut and tasty. Also tried the Niçoise salad which was a delicious lighter option--the tuna was perfect with potatoes, eggs, and green beans. The banoffee pie was a small portion for $7, but very good. The only miss was the cheddar biscuit which came out a bit too dry and crumbled into small pieces when I cut it.

Upon our seating, our very nice server sold us on the 6 course Pre Fix. Neither of us had much of an idea of what to order or expect. We have had poor experiences with Indian Food in the past, however we wanted to try at a higher level of eatery before we closed the doors forever to eating this type of food. 

I think the quality of the ingredients, the staff, the portions, the ambiance was top notch.
The other person joining me loved the meal. But for a few exceptions, Please understand, I realize there is a difference between a quality meal which this was, and me just hating the tastes. I'll list the courses. And my ending of this challenging meal.

Started with some sort of cold soup. - to me it was ok. The other person said it tasted like vomit.
Fried Spinach Salad - Fantastic texture and taste! Simply marvelous, Both of us loved it.
Seared Scallops,- Over cooked by a hair, not seared properly. Very sweet Sauce inedible. The other person liked it. Here take mine.
Lolly POP of a Lamb Rib with a Small Chicken Breast. - To me inedible, tangy and very spicy. Chicken was in a spicy Coconut Chutney. The other person loved it, I hated it. The Naan Bread which came with it sucked.
Pork Shank with a roasted Potato. To me inedible. Other person enjoyed it.

Dessert was Fig Ice Cream Drizzled with Honey. I hated it, Inedible, Too sweet. The other person enjoyed it.

I think this type of food is not for everyone. I gave it an honest shot.Never again will I eat Indian Food I did not enjoy it from start to finish.  I didn't eat anything but for the one fantastic salad course.

I think evaluating the experience honestly is to say, if you like Indian Food, you probably will very much enjoy this place. However I won't be joining you.

I went with a friend during Farm to Fork restaurant week and we were very impressed. First of all, I showed up early and the hostess accommodated me and seated me right away. Arugula just might be one of THE most gourmet establishments in the area. Everything from the menu choices to the ingredients to the plating was exceptional. I had carrot risotto (unique and delicious) followed by an arugula salad and squid ink spaghetti alla chitarra. There were a lot of fresh Jersey vegetables on the menu because of farm to fork, so I appreciated the flavors of smoky grilled corn and fresh Jersey peaches. Our waitress was fantastic (and funny) and the maitre'd took excellent care of us. The dessert (specifically the chocolate mousse with hazelnut brittle) was amazing, and we were definitely hooked up with some homemade strawberry-cello and pineapple-cello as well. The portions were perfect for the courses, and I left feeling full (unusual because I usually eat a lot more). My friend got mussels (which I'm not a fan of), and the broth they came in was so good I wanted to drink it (I dipped my bread in it instead). The only improvement in my opinion would be a little more light - we went while it was still light out and it was just so dark in there.
